Abstract: We explicitly construct all supersymmetric flux vacua of a particular
Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory for a small number of flux
carrying cycles and a given D3-brane tadpole. The analysis is performed in the large
complex structure region by using the polynomial homotopy continuation method,
which allows to find all stationary points of the polynomial equations that characterize the supersymmetric vacuum solutions. The number of vacua as a function of
the D3 tadpole is in agreement with statistical studies in the literature. We calculate the available tuning of the cosmological constant from fluxes and extrapolate to
scenarios with a larger number of flux carrying cycles. We also verify the range of
scales for the moduli and gravitino masses recently found for a single explicit flux
choice giving a Kähler uplifted de Sitter vacuum in the same construction.

Introduction

The question of the vacuum states of string theory has been an outstanding problem in the field since its founding days. Those vacua which could describe our
world are of particular interest. Apart from a standard model sector including the
corresponding gauge groups and matter in the right representations of these gauge
groups, such vacua should have a positive vacuum energy that is extremely small
in terms of the natural scale of gravity, the Planck / string scale [1–3]. In addition, one may wish for 4D N = 1 supersymmetry for its power to keep control over
quantum corrections to the theory above the supersymmetry breaking / electroweak
scale. There has been remarkable progress in the construction of such de Sitter (dS)
vacua with stabilized geometric moduli in the past years [4–6]. The moduli are 4D
massless scalar fields parametrizing the geometric deformation modes of the compact
six-dimensional spaces all viable Kaluza-Klein type vacua of string theory need to
describe our effectively four-dimensional reality.
A corner of the string theory landscape where moduli stabilization can be addressed very explicitly is type IIB compactified on orientifolded Calabi-Yau threefolds. The four-dimensional effective action of the geometric moduli is given by an

–1–

N = 1 theory of a set of chiral multiplets consisting of the axio-dilaton, h1,1 Kähler
moduli, and h2,1 complex structure moduli [7]. Recent years saw a progress for the
stabilization of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli from the use of quantized fluxes of three form field strength of the Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz
sector of type IIB string theory [5]. The flux stabilization procedure operates supersymmetrically at a high scale. The Kähler moduli are flat directions at tree level, i.e.
they do not obtain a scalar potential due to the no-scale structure of type IIB compactified on Calabi-Yau [8, 9]. We can use the breaking of this no-scale structure by
non-perturbative [6] and perturbative [10, 11] effects to stabilize the Kähler moduli
at a parametrically lower scale than the complex structure moduli. This stabilization
produces in an AdS vacuum with unbroken supersymmetry [6], an AdS vacuum with
spontaneously broken supersymmetry with an exponentially large volume [12, 13] or
directly in a dS vacuum with spontaneously broken supersymmetry [14, 15].
If the stabilization of the geometric moduli does not directly lead to a dS vacuum,
an additional uplifting sector has to be added. The uplifting may arise for instance by
anti D3 branes [6], D-terms [16–18], F-terms from matter fields [19], metastable vacua
in gauge theories [20] or dilaton dependent non-perturbative effects [21]. Concerning
the smallness of the cosmological constant, statistical arguments show that due to the
enormous amount of possible flux configurations there is an exponential abundance
of isolated potential dS vacua [22–24]. For a sufficiently large number of complex
structure moduli h2,1 (typically O(100)) the number of flux vacua and, in turn, also
2,1
the number of dS vacua scaling like eO(1) h is large enough to produce vacuum
energies with average spacing . 10−120 . This enables the flux vacuum landscape
in string theory in principle to accommodate the observed vacuum energy of our
Universe.
In this paper, we study the flux vacua of a particular Calabi-Yau: The degree 18
hypersurface in a 4 complex dimensional projective space X3 ≡ CP411169 [18] in the
large complex structure limit. This manifold is the standard working example of both
the large volume scenario (LVS) [12, 13] and the Kähler uplifting scenario [14, 15]
and its geometric properties have been worked out in great detail in [25]. It has
h1,1 = 2 Kähler moduli and h2,1 = 272 complex structure moduli. We switch on
flux along six three-cycles that correspond to two complex structure moduli that are
invariant under a certain discrete symmetry that can be used to construct the mirror
manifold [26]. For this purpose we review a known argument that a supersymmetric
vacuum in these two complex structure moduli corresponds to a supersymmetric
vacuum of all 272 complex structure moduli [27, 28].
For an explicit construction of the flux vacua we use the fact that the prepotential
G of the two complex structure moduli space has been worked out in [25] in the large
complex structure limit. We apply two computational methods to find flux vacua on

–2–

this manifold:
• The polynomial homotopy continuation method [29] allows us to find all stationary points of the polynomial equations that characterize the supersymmetric
vacuum solutions. The fluxes fi ∈ Z appear as parameters in these equations
and are restricted by the D3 tadpole L which depends on the chosen brane
and gauge flux configuration imposed on the manifold. Since the restriction
P 2
is of the form
fi ≤ L this method allows us to explicitly construct for the
first time all flux vacua in the large complex structure limit that are consistent
with a given D3 tadpole L by applying the polynomial homotopy continuation
method at each point in flux parameter space. This method has the attractive
feature to be highly parallelizable.
• The minimal flux method [28] finds flux parameters that are consistent with
a given D3 tadpole L for a given set of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of
the complex structure moduli. Hence it is in a sense complementary to the
polynomial homotopy continuation method where the role of parameters and
solutions is exchanged with respect to this method. However, it is not possible
to find all flux vacua for a given tadpole L with this method.
The obtained solution space of flux vacua is analyzed for several physically interesting properties. For the polynomial homotopy continuation method, we find that
for the ∼ 50, 000 flux choices contained in our maximum D3-brane tadpole L = 34 of
our scan there are ∼ 20, 000 solutions in the large complex structure limit. We find a
preference of strongly coupled vacua gs & 1 and preference for values of O(101 − 103 )
for the flux superpotential W0 . The number of vacua is
Nvac ≃ (0.52 ± 0.04) L2.92±0.03 ,

(1.1)

compared to ∼ 0.03L3 expected form statistical analysis [24, 30]. The gravitino
mass is typically m23/2 = O(10−3 ) · ( 100

moduli and the dilaton scale like O(10−3 − 102 ) · ( 100
)2 MP2 , where V is the Volume
V
of X3 in string units.
The average spacing of the flux superpotential in our solution set can be used to
estimate the available fine-tuning ∆Λ/Λ of the cosmological constant Λ as
2,1
∆Λ
≃ (5.1 ± 0.3) L−(0.93±0.006) (heff +1) ,

(1.2)

2,1
where heff
is the number of complex structure moduli with non-zero flux on the cor2,1
responding three-cycles. Eq. (1.2) is obtained as a fit for L ≤ 34 and heff
= 2. It
can be used to estimate the available fine-tuning of the cosmological constant to for
instance ∆Λ/Λ ∼ 10−100 for L = 500 and h2,1
eff = 40. These are typical values for

–3–

Calabi-Yau manifolds that are hypersurfaces in toric varieties with D7 branes and
O7 planes introduced to stabilize the Kähler moduli and break supersymmetry.
The explicit brane and gauge flux construction in [15] allows us to answer the question how many of theses supersymmetric flux vacua allow an uplift to dS via Kähler
uplifting. Depending on the available values for the one-loop determinant from gaugino condensation used to stabilize the Kähler moduli in this setup, we find that for a
fraction of about 10−4 of all flux vacua up to a given D3-brane tadpole this mechanism
can be applied to obtain a dS vacuum.
For the minimal flux method, we find ∼ 1000 flux vacua with L < 500 out of
∼ 107 parameter points of our scan. This method allows us to control the region in
W0 and moduli space where we are intending to find flux vacua. Hence, we more
easily access the regions of weak string coupling and the large complex structure
limit compared to the polynomial homotopy continuation method. For this much
smaller set of flux vacua constructed with the minimal flux method, the fraction of
Kähler uplifted dS minima is about 10%. This is a considerably higher fraction of
vacua compared to the polynomial homotopy continuation method which is due to
the fact that the minimal flux method naturally finds values for W0 in a region where
Kähler uplifting is applicable.
Our results are complementary to statistical analysis by [24, 30].1 The uniform
distribution of physical quantities as for instance the gravitino mass and the vacuum
energy density in the landscape has recently been questioned in general [34–36] and
in the context of Kähler uplifting [37–39]. Hence, our results present an important
check of the general results found in [24, 30] on a very realistic examples X3 , especially
since we are able to construct the complete solution space of flux vacua for a given
tadpole L.
In section 2, we review the effective 4d, N = 1 description of the complex structure moduli and the dilaton as well as the reduction of the full moduli space to
two complex structure moduli. The scans for flux vacua with the polynomial homotopy continuation method and the minimal flux method are presented in section 3
respectively section 4. We conclude in section 5.

Note, that there are h2,1 + 1 coordinates ω0 , .., ωh2,1 even though there are only

well as non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential and K. However, these
corrections are parametrically small in every moduli stabilization scenario where the
overall volume of X3 is large. Hence, the scalar potential for the dilaton and complex

Note that due to the appearance of the symplectic matrix, the tadpole eq. (2.9)
is at first not positive definite. However, as has been discussed in [5, 24], imposing
the supersymmetry conditions Da W = 0 results in G3 = F3 − τ H3 being imaginary
self-dual (ISD). Since the ISD component of G3 always results in positive semidefinite contributions to the tadpole while the anti-ISD component of G3 always
yields negative semi-definite contributions, a supersymmetric point always has L ≥ 0.
This can be seen nicely if the ISD condition is displayed as [44]

–7–

As was discussed in [25], eq. (2.19) is invariant under a global Γ = Z6 × Z18 symmetry. This symmetry is used in the Greene-Plesser construction [26] to construct
the mirror Calabi-Yau which in this case has h1,1 = 272 and h2,1 = 2. Furthermore,
the moduli ψ and φ in eq. (2.19) describe the two complex structure moduli of this
mirror manifold. As was pointed out in [45], the periods of the mirror agree with
those of CP411169 [18] at the Γ symmetric point. Also, [45] shows that the complete set
of h2,1 complex structure moduli can be divided into a Γ-invariant subspace and its
complement. The moduli with trivial transformation are exactly those that do not
vanish at the Γ symmetric point, in this case ψ and φ.
To make use of the agreement of the prepotential for the complex structure sector
of CP411169 [18] and its mirror in the large complex structure limit, it is useful to
introduce the complex coordinates U1 and U2 that are related to ψ and φ as [25]

(2.22)

Let us come back to the problem of finding supersymmetric extrema by solving
eq. (2.14). As was noted in [28, 46], to find an extremum it is sufficient to turn on
fluxes only along the six Γ-invariant three-cycles, i.e.
f = (f11 , f12 , f13 , f21 , f22 , f23 , 0, ..., 0) and h = (h11 , h12 , h13 , h21 , h22 , h23 , 0, ..., 0) ,
(2.23)
having set to zero all the components along the b3 − 6 non-invariant three-cycles.
It is then possible to achieve Da W = 0 for all 272 complex structure moduli,3 and
3

Note that orientifolding will project out some of the 272 complex structure moduli. Since the
exact number of projected out directions depends on the position of the O-plane we stick to the
upper bound of 272 for a general treatment.

–8–

hence to find a minimum of the positive definite tree-level no-scale scalar potential
eq. (2.13). This is due to the fact that, for this Γ invariant flux, the symmetry Γ is
realized at the level of the four-dimensional effective action. Note that the restriction
to flux on the Γ invariant cycles is purely for simplicity, as the analysis of the complete
272 dimensional complex structure moduli space is practically extremely challenging.
Let us explain more detailed why the flux vector in eq. (2.23) generically provides
a stable minimum of all 272 complex structure moduli [28, 46]. We first consider
DŨa W0 = 0, where Ũa for a = 3, . . . , 272 denote the non-trivially transforming moduli under Γ = Z6 × Z18 . In the large complex structure limit, the prepotential G
is a polynomial function of all h2,1 complex structure moduli that has to transform
trivially under Γ, since if it would not, Γ could be used to fix the non-trivially transforming moduli.4 Hence, the non-trivially transforming Ũa have to appear at least
quadratic in G in order to represent a Γ invariant contribution to G. This information, together with having switched on flux only along the Γ invariant directions, is
sufficient to show
W0,Ũa = KŨa = 0 at Ũa = 0 for a = 3, . . . , 272 ,

(2.24)

since W0,Ũa is a polynomial function which is at least linear in the Ũa , see eq. (2.8)
and KŨa is a rational function which is at least linear in the numerator in the Ũa ,
see eq. (2.3). Hence, DŨa W0 = W0,Ũa + KŨa W0 = 0 at Ũa = 0 for a = 3, . . . , 272.
This reduces the full set of conditions Da W = 0 ∀a to the three equations
DI W |Ũa =0 = 0

for I = τ, U1 , U2 .

(2.25)

This is equivalent to set Ũa = 0 from the beginning and study the stabilization
problem for the reduced case with two complex structure moduli, as we do in the
following.
In [25], the prepotential G for the two complex structure moduli U1 = ω1 /ω0 and
U2 = ω2 /ω0 was derived via mirror symmetry in the large complex structure limit to
be

G completely determines the moduli space of the (before orientifolding) N = 2 moduli space.
If it would not be invariant the complex structure moduli space would have been reduced, i.e. some
flat directions lifted but this does not happen just because there exists a Γ symmetric point.

The polynomial homotopy continuation method

We want to solve the non-linear eqs. (2.25) derived from the prepotential eq. (2.26)
for the 6 real variables xi = u1 , u2 , s, ν1 , ν2 and σ. The parameters of these equations
are the 12 fluxes f1 , f2 , h1 and h2 in eq. (2.23). Though systems of non-linear equations are extremely difficult to solve in general, if the non-linearity in the system is
polynomial-like, then the recently developed algebraic geometry methods can rescue
the situation. In particular, we use the so-called numerical polynomial homotopy
continuation (NPHC) method [29] which finds all the solutions of the given system
of polynomial equations. This method has been used in various problems in particle
theory and statistical mechanics in Refs. [47–57].
3.1

The algorithm

Here we briefly explain the NPHC method: for a system of polynomial equations,
P (x) = 0, where P (x) = (p1 (x), . . . , pm (x))T and x = (x1 , . . . , xm )T , which is known
to have isolated solutions, the Classical Bézout Theorem asserts that for generic
Q
values of coefficients, the maximum number of solutions in Cm is m
i=1 di . Here, di
is the degree of the ith polynomial. This bound, the classical Bézout bound (CBB),
is exact for generic values [29, 58] for details.
Based on the CBB, a homotopy can be constructed as
H(x, t) = γ(1 − t)Q(x) + t P (x),

(3.1)

where γ is a generic complex number and t ∈ [0, 1). Q(x) = (q1 (x), . . . , qm (x))T is a
system of polynomial equations with the following properties:

– 10 –

1. the solutions of Q(x) = H(x, 0) = 0 are known or can be easily obtained. Q(x)
is called the start system and the solutions are called the start solutions,
2. the number of solutions of Q(x) = H(x, 0) = 0 is equal to the CBB for P (x) =
0,
3. the solution set of H(x, t) = 0 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 consists of a finite number of
smooth paths, called homotopy paths, each parameterized by t ∈ [0, 1), and
4. every isolated solution of H(x, 1) = P (x) = 0 can be reached by some path
originating at a solution of H(x, 0) = Q(x) = 0.
The start system Q(x) = 0 can for example be taken to be

 d1
x1 − 1


..
Q(x) = 
 = 0,
.

(3.2)

xdmm − 1

where di is the degree of the ith polynomial of the original system P (x) = 0. Eq. (3.2)
Q
is easy to solve and guarantees that the total number of start solutions is m
i=1 di ,
all of which are non-singular.
We can then track all the paths corresponding to each solution of Q(x) = 0 from
t = 0 to t = 1. The paths which reach P (x) = 0 = H(x, 1) are the solutions of
P (x) = 0. By implementing an efficient path tracker algorithm, all isolated solutions
of a system of multivariate polynomials system can be obtained because it is shown
[29] that for a generic γ, there are no singularities (i.e., paths do not cross each other)
for t ∈ [0, 1). In this respect, the NPHC method has a great advantage over all other
known methods for finding stationary points.
There are several sophisticated numerical packages well-equipped with path trackers such as Bertini[59], PHCpack [60], PHoM [61] and HOM4PS2 [58, 62]. We mainly
use Bertini to get the results in this paper.
We mean by a solution a set of values of variables which satisfies the eqs. (2.25)
with tolerance 10−10 . All the solutions come with real and imaginary parts. A
solution is a real solution if the imaginary part of each of the variables is less than
or equal to the tolerance 10−6 (below which the number of real solutions does not
change, i.e., it is robust for the problem at hand). All these solutions can be further
refined to an arbitrary precision.
The advantages of the homotopy based on the CBB are (1) the CBB is easy to
compute, and (2) the start system based on the CBB can be solved quickly. The
drawback of it is that the CBB does not take the sparsity of the system into account:
systems arising in practice have far fewer solutions than the CBB, so a large portion
of the computational effort is wasted.

– 11 –

Hence, one can also use homotopies based on tighter upper bounds. For example, one can compute the so-called 2-Homogeneous Bézout Bound or the BernsteinKhovanskii-Kushnirenko bound [63–65] which are tighter upper bounds. These two
bounds were explained in Ref. [47, 54]. We note that, as with the CBB, the 2HomBB
and BKK bound are also generically sharp with respect to the family of polynomial
systems under consideration.
There is yet another, rather more practical, way of solving a parametric system
which is called Cheater’s homotopy [66, 67]: let us say we want to solve a parametric
system, f~(~q; ~x) = ~0 where ~x are variables and ~q are parameters, in our case the fluxes.
Now, it can be shown [66, 67] that the maximum number of complex solutions at
any parameter point is the number of solutions at a generic parametric point. So our
strategy is first to solve the system at a generic parameter point and then using the
solutions at this point as the start solutions for the systems at all other parameterpoints. This homotopy is called cheater’s homotopy. A recently developed software,
based on Bertini, called Paramotopy [68], precisely uses cheater’s homotopy and
goes over a huge number of parameter points in parallel. The package is publicly
not available yet though the respective research group has kindly given access to the
code for the purpose of the computation in this paper. We will publish the details
on the cheater’s homotopy and the package Paramotopy elsewhere [69].
3.2

The scan

We define a set of flux parameters on which we apply the algorithm described in the
previous section 3.1. Since we are only interested in supersymmetric flux vacua, we
can make use of the ISD condition eq. (2.15) and define a flux configuration via
H3 =



h1
h2



and

F3 =



−h2

(3.3)

with h1 , h2 ∈ Z3 . Note that since we have two complex structure moduli we have
initially 2 · 2 + 2 = 6 flux parameters for both H3 and F3 but the ISD condition
eq. (2.15) reduces this to the six parameters given in eq. (3.3). Furthermore, the D3
tadpole eq. (2.9) becomes manifestly positive semi-definite, i.e.
L = h21 + h22 .

(3.4)

To scan efficiently, we apply the paramotopy algorithm only to SL(2, Z) inequivalent flux configurations. Note that a configuration of the form eq. (3.3) transforms

Note that the two transformations on the LHS of eq. (3.6) do not transform the
dilaton τ 0 = τ while the two transformations on the RHS act as τ 0 = −1/τ .
The number of SL(2, Z) inequivalent flux configurations in a spherical region
√
defined by a spherical constraint eq. (3.4) can be estimated as π 3 /(4 Γ[4])( L)6 ,
using the formula for the volume of the n-sphere Vn (r) = π n/2 /Γ(n/2 + 1) rn . The
factor 1/4 accounts for the 4 equivalent configurations in eq. (3.7). If we had switched
on more flux n > 6 the number of lattice points grows very rapidly ∼ Ln/2 .
For our scan, we choose L = 34 such that we scan over 52,329 parameter points
(the above estimate yields 55,391). On the FermiLab cluster using 100 nodes each
with 32 cores (each core with 2.0 GHz cloak speed), the calculation time in total is
around 75, 000 hours, with 60 − 100 minutes per parameter point.
3.3

Distribution of parameters

In this section, we want to discuss the distribution of the following parameters as
results of the scan defined in the previous section 3.2:
• u1 and u2 , to see how many points reach the large complex structure limit as
defined in eq. (2.28).
• τ , to identify regions of weak respectively strong coupling.
• The number of solutions for a given D3 tadpole L.
• W0 , the flux superpotential.
• The masses of the moduli m2 and the gravitino mass m23/2 .
• The available fine-tuning ∆Λ of the cosmological constant Λ.
• The amount of flux vacua for which a dS vacuum can be constructed via Kähler
uplifting in 3.4.

(gray) and for the physical solutions fulfilling the criterion for the validity of the large
complex structure limit (blue for LCS = 10−1 and black for LCS = 10−2 ), eq. (2.28).
For the 52,329 parameter points, we find a total of 500,865 solutions to the
eqs. (2.25). This corresponds to an average of 9.5 solutions per parameter point.
For 1,270 parameter points we do not find a solution. Many of the solutions are
unphysical and hence have to be sorted out: A subset of 271,825 fulfill the criterion
of a physical string coupling gs > 0 and only a subset of 24,882 respective 15,392 is
in accordance with the large complex structure criterion eq. (2.28) for LCS = 10−1
respective LCS = 10−2 . Of these none have to be sorted out because they are in
the vicinity of the conifold singularities eq. (2.29) having chosen CF = 10−2 . Due
to the strong suppression of the large complex structure limit in the general solution
space of eq. (2.25) the minimal flux method has the advantage of directly searching
for solutions in this region.

in eq. (3.11) was estimated in [28] to be be 1/1296, using the Γ symmetry of the
moduli space such that
Nvac ≃ 0.03 L3 .
(3.12)
Since paramotopy allows us to find all solutions for a given flux configuration we
can not only check the L dependence of eq. (3.11) but also the normalization. This
depends on the value chosen for LCS , i.e. a greater LCS will yield a larger normalization factor. Fitting the number of solutions with h2 ≤ L in the large complex
structure limit to the tadpole L we find
Nvac ≃ (0.52 ± 0.04) L2.92±0.03

LCS = 10−2 ,

Note that Nvac ∼ L6 in [28] which is due to the fact that 12 independent fluxes have been
switched on while we effectively switch on 6 independent fluxes, see eq. (3.3).

Figure 3: The number of vacua Nvac with h2 < L (left) and the logarithmic distribution of the flux superpotential W0 (right) in the large complex structure limit
with LCS = 10−2 .
The dependence of Nvac on L and the fit in eq. (3.13) are shown in Figure 3. Considering the very general arguments that are used to derive the estimate eq. (3.11), the
agreement within an order of magnitude with the factual number of vacua strongly
confirms the statistical analysis of [24, 30]. In the following, we set LCS = 10−2 .
The distribution of the flux superpotential is shown in Figure 3. We find that
for most vacua O(101 − 103 ) values are preferred. To calculate the masses of the
moduli we have to know the value of the volume V of X3 which enters via the Kähler
potential of the Kähler moduli given in eq. (2.11). Note that we have not specified
the stabilization mechanism for the Kähler moduli and hence have no information
about the value of V. For the KKLT and Kähler uplifting scenarios the volume is
typically stabilized at O(102 − 104 ) while for the LVS it is O(106 − 1015 ). Hence, we
can only calculate the physical masses m up to factors of V −1 , i.e.

values of h1,1 there could be strong suppressions of tachyonic free configurations [34–
36]. In the following section, we will determine how many de Sitter vacua can be
constructed from our dataset on X3 via the method of Kähler uplifting.

de Sitter vacua via Kähler uplifting

The two Kähler moduli T1 and T2 of X3 can be stabilized in a dS minimum by Kähler
uplifting. A globally consistent D7 brane and gauge flux setup that realizes such a
dS vacuum has been presented in [15]. The Kähler potential of T1 and T2 is given as

we need to balance the leading order α0 correction to the Kähler potential with
non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential. These originate from gaugino
condensation of an SU (24) and SO(24) pure super Yang Mills from respectively 24 D7
branes wrapping the divisors corresponding to T1 and T2 . The induced superpotential
is

(3.23)
W = W0 + A1 e− 24 T1 + A2 e− 22 T2 .
By switching on suitable gauge flux it can be shown [15] that A1 , A2 6= 0. The induced
D3 tadpole by this gauge flux and the geometric contributions from the D7 branes
is L = 96 − 104. The one-loop determinants A1 and A2 depend on the complex
structure moduli, the dilaton and also potentially D7 brane moduli. The explicit
dependence on these moduli is unknown, however for the purpose of Kähler moduli
stabilization the values of A1 and A2 can be assumed be constant since complex
structure moduli are stabilized at a higher scale. Choosing A1 = A2 = 1, it was
found numerically in [15], that the pairs of W0 and s that are suitable to realize a
dS vacuum with small positive tree level vacuum energy 8 lie on the curve
W0dS (s) = 70.2 s−2.35

with

s ≥ 4.

To parametrize our missing knowledge of the values of A1 and A2 we introduce
the parameter ∆A and the scaling relations
W0 → W0 · ∆A ,

A2 → A2 · ∆A ,

In this case, small refers to how small we can tune hV i by choosing numerical values for W0
and s to a certain decimal place and is not related to the tuning of the cosmological constant.

We show the number of Kähler uplifted dS vacua depending on ∆A in Figure 5.
Due to the suppression of weakly coupled vacua s  1 and O(1) values of the
superpotential, the number of vacua that can be uplifted to dS via Kähler uplifting
is strongly suppressed. For ∆A = 10, only 6, i.e. a fraction of ∼ 10−4 of the total
number of flux vacua allow such an uplifting.
The available tuning of the cosmological constant via fluxes can be estimated
again via eq. (3.18). The Kähler moduli stabilization yields a volume of V ≃ 50 [15]
such that the untuned cosmological constant is Λ ∼ 5 · 10−6 and
∆Λ
≃ 0.51 ± 0.37 ,

for ∆A = 10. We remind the reader, that this is calculated for L = 34 which is
the maximal value we reach in our paramotopy scan and hence less than L = 104
which is maximally allowed by the gauge flux and D7 brane construction realized for
a Kähler uplifted dS vacuum in our explicit CP411169 [18] example.
To summarize this section, the polynomial homotopy continuation method allows
us to find all flux vacua for a given D3 tadpole L. The number of these vacua is well

– 20 –

estimated by the statistical analysis of [24, 30]. We find that strongly coupled vacua
s & 1 are preferred as well as O(101 − 103 ) values of W0 . Our results can be used
to estimate the tunability of the cosmological constant by fluxes and the number of
flux vacua that can be Kähler uplifted to a dS vacuum.

4

The minimal flux method

In this section we describe the method to find flux vacua that has been first used by
Denef, Douglas and Florea [28]. In contrast to the polynomial homotopy continuation
method described in section 3, we fix starting values for the VEVs hU1 if ix , hU2 if ix
and hτ if ix and solve for the flux values f and h.
4.1

The algorithm

Due to the linear dependence of W0 on f and h, see eq. (2.8), the quantities DI W0 =
W0I + KI W0 for I = τ, U1 , U2 are linear in these flux vectors. Hence, if we want to
solve the system of equations
(W0 , Dτ W0 , DU1 W0 , DU2 W0 ) = 0 ,

(4.1)

M · (f, h) = 0 ,

(4.2)

this can be written as
with M ∈ R8×12 for general VEVs hU1 i, hU2 i, hτ i ∈ C. The dimensions of M are due
to the fact that we have 8 real equations in eq. (4.1), and there are 12 flux integers in
total in f and h. Note that we have also included the condition W0 = 0 in eq. (4.1).
In fact, we are not interested in flux vacua where W0 is strictly zero since none of
the well studied moduli stabilization mechanisms KKLT [6], LVS [13] and Kähler
uplifting [12, 14, 15, 70] apply in this situation. However, eq. (4.1) will only serve as
a starting point and we will eventually end up with vacua where W0 6= 0 and O(1).
For M ∈ R8×12 there is no hope to find a solution of eq. (4.2) since the flux parameters have to be integers. However, if we neglect instanton corrections induced by
eq. (2.27) and choose rational starting values hU1 i, hU2 i, hτ i ∈ Q + i Q in the superζ(3)χ
= −1.30843.. i.
potential, the only transcendental number in eq. (4.2) is ξ = 2(2π
i)3
If we approximate ξ by a rational number ξrat , for instance ξrat = −13/10 i, we have
accomplished M ∈ Q8×12 .
Now, we can hope to find a solution of eq. (4.2) although the entries of f and h will
be generically be quite large for generic M , since one generally expects them to be at
least of the order of the lowest common denominator of the entries of M . This puts
tension on the D3 tadpole constraint eq. (2.9) since generally the geometry of the
compactification manifold and D7 brane configuration generates L ∼ 102 − 104 . We

– 21 –

use the same algorithms [71] as the authors of [28], to generate as small as possible
values for the entries of f and h in order to generate a not too large D3 tadpole
L < Lmax where we choose Lmax = 500 to be the maximal value for the D3 tadpole
that we consider.
Since the system of equations eq. (4.2) is under determined, the solution space is
given by all linear combinations of linearly independent vectors (f, h)i for i = 1, .., 4,
where each (f, h)i is a solution to eq. (4.2), i.e.
(f, h)sol =

4
X

with ai ∈ Z .

ai (f, h)i

(4.3)

i=1

For obvious practical reasons, we cannot consider all possible values of the ai . Since
L(ai (f, h)i ) = a2i L((f, h)i ) and tadpoles of solution basis vectors smaller than ten
are extremely rare, we can safely restrict ourselves to −3 < ai < 3 in order to fulfill
L((f, h)sol ) < Lmax .
In the next step, we are looking for solutions to eq. (2.25), including instanton
corrections eq. (2.27) to the prepotential and also setting ξ to its transcendental
value. We insert the flux solution (f, h)sol into the equations
(Dτ W0 , DU1 W0 , DU2 W0 ) = 0

(with instanton corrections) ,

(4.4)

leaving the VEVs hU1 i, hU2 i and hτ i unfixed. These are six real equations for six
real variables and we can numerically search for a solution in the vicinity of hU1 if ix ,
hU2 if ix and hτ if ix . It has to be checked case by case if the complex structure limit
is still valid for these perturbed solutions. The shift of the VEVs from their fixed
values may also induce a shift in the superpotential, i.e. W0 is not zero anymore.
However, note that the value that W0 will take in the end is not in any way under
our control and it has to be checked if one obtains useful values for the purpose of
moduli stabilization.
The above outlined algorithm can be iterated by sampling over a set of VEVs
hU1 if ix , hU2 if ix and hτ if ix and approximate ξ values ξrat .
4.2

The scan

First of all, we need to define a set of rational starting values (hU1 i, hU2 i, hτ i, ξrat )f ix
over which the algorithm explained in section 4.1 can be iterated. We set the axionic
components of the fixed VEV’s to zero, i.e.
RehU1 if ix = RehU2 if ix = Rehτ if ix = 0 .

(4.5)

Let x ∈ [xmin , xmax ] represent ξrat and the imaginary parts of the moduli. We use

as the set of rational numbers that fills out the interval [xmin , xmax ]. minZ (x) and
maxZ (x) define the smallest integer greater than or equal to x respectively the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Note that qmax determines how ‘dense’ the interval
is filled with rational numbers. For example, one has

Table 2: Starting values for ξrat and the imaginary parts of the moduli. The last

The set of starting values given in Table 2 is chosen such that the starting values
for the complex structure moduli are in the large complex structure limit eq. (2.28)
and the string coupling gs = 1/s is always larger than one. The total number of
points in the grid of starting values defined in Table 2 has 12,184,240 points. Using
80 cores with 2.4 GHz of the DESY Theory Cluster this yields a total calculation
time of approximately four weeks.

Results

We find 1,698 solutions fulfilling the constraint L < Lmax = 500 which is only
0.01% of the total number of points of
the scan. Hence, most of the time one
can not find a flux vector whose entries
are small enough to fulfill the D3 tadpole
constraint.
As in section 3.3, we can make use of the
SL(2, Z) transformations eq. (3.9) and
eq. (3.10) to transform every solution to
the fundamental domain eq. (3.8). Identifying equivalent solutions in this domain, 1,374 elements of the original solution set are not related via SL(2, Z)
symmetry and hence physically inequivalent. The distribution of τ is shown in
Figure 6. Compared to the paramotopy
scan we more easily find weakly coupled
vacua with s  1 which is due to the fact
that we have chosen the starting values
for s accordingly, see Table 2.

Figure 6: Distribution of τ for the
minimal flux scan.

The distribution of u1 and u2 as well as the distribution of the superpotential are
shown in Figure 7. We find that there are no flux vacua in the vicinity of the conifold
singularities eq. (2.29) for CF = 10−2 . Also, all flux vacua fulfill the constraint of the
validity of the large complex structure limit description, eq. (2.28) for LCS = 10−2
which is again due to the chosen starting values deep in the large complex structure
limit, Table 2. Since we solve for vanishing W0 in the first step of the algorithm
eq. (4.1), we obtain a clustering around W0 = 0, see Figure 7. This is however not a
general property of the complete solution space as we noted in section 3.3 but rather
O(10 − 100) values are preferred.
We fit the number of vacua as a function of the D3 tadpole L, finding Nvac ≃
0.02 L1.83 which strongly deviates from the estimate eq. (3.11). However, our dataset
of 1,374 is in no way representative for the total number of flux vacua with L = 500
such that this deviation can be easily explained by insufficient statistics.
Finally, we can calculate how many flux vacua allow a dS vacuum via Kähler
uplifting along the lines of section 3.4. Since the minimal flux scan is setup such that

– 24 –

Figure 7: Distribution of u1 and u2 (left) and superpotential W0 for the minimal
flux scan.
the values of s and |W0 | naturally lie in the region where Kähler uplifting can be
applied we find a much milder suppression of these vacua compared to section 3.3,
see Figure 8. For ∆A = 10, three of the 75 flux vacua with L = 104 and 135 of the
1,374 flux vacua with L = 500 allow a dS vacuum via Kähler uplifting.9 Repeating
the estimate of eq. (3.27) for the results of the minimal flux scan, the cosmological
constant Λ ∼ 10−6 can be tuned to an accuracy

To conclude this section, the minimal flux method has the advantage that one can
specify the region in parameter space where physically interesting flux vacua should
be constructed. In our case this region is defined by the large complex structure limit,
weak string coupling and O(1) values of W0 . However, it is not possible to construct
all flux vacua for a given D3 tadpole L which can be done using paramotopy and the
method is rather inefficient in the sense that only 0.01% of the starting values yield
a flux vacuum.

The maximum D3 tadpole of X3 is L = 104 but due to the small amount of vacua we find for
this tadpole we also show the results for L = 500.

Conclusions

In this paper we have studied the flux vacua of type IIB string theory compactified
on CP411169 [18] Calabi-Yau hypersurface, i.e. the standard working example of both
the LVS and the Kähler uplifting scenario. We switch on flux along six three-cycles
that correspond to two complex structure moduli that are invariant under a certain
discrete symmetry that can be used to construct the mirror manifold. As explained
in the main text, such a supersymmetric vacuum in these two complex structure
moduli extends to a supersymmetric vacuum of all 272 complex structure moduli.

To explicitly construct flux vacua, we make use of the fact that the prepotential G
of the two complex structure moduli space has been worked out in the large complex
structure limit. We apply two computational methods to find flux vacua on this
manifold: The polynomial homotopy continuation method allows us to explicitly
construct for the first time all flux vacua in the large complex structure limit that
are consistent with a given D3 tadpole L by applying the polynomial homotopy
continuation method at each point in flux parameter space. The minimal flux method
finds flux parameters that are consistent with a given D3 tadpole L for a given set
of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the complex structure moduli.
We analyze the resulting solution space of flux vacua for several physically interesting properties. For the polynomial homotopy continuation method, we find that
for the ∼ 50, 000 parameter points of our scan there are ∼ 20, 000 solutions in the
large complex structure limit. We find a preference of strongly coupled vacua gs & 1
and preference for values of O(101 −103 ) for the flux superpotential W0 . The number
of vacua is
Nvac ≃ (0.52 ± 0.04) L2.92±0.03 ,
(5.1)
compared to ∼ 0.03L3 expected form statistical analysis [24, 30]. The gravitino
mass is typically m23/2 = O(10−3 ) · ( 100
)2 MP2 and the masses of the complex structure
V
moduli and the dilaton scale like O(10−3 − 102 ) · ( 100
)2 MP2 . These ranges for the
V
moduli and gravitino masses are compatible with the values obtained for a single
explicit flux choice in the same construction [14, 15].
The average spacing of the flux superpotential in our solution set can be used to
estimate the available fine-tuning ∆Λ/Λ of the cosmological constant Λ as
2,1
∆Λ
≃ (5.1 ± 0.3) L−(0.93±0.006) (heff +1) ,
Λ

(5.2)

which corresponds to for instance ∆Λ/Λ ∼ 10−100 for L = 500 and h2,1
eff = 40. The
explicit brane and gauge flux construction in [15] allows us to answer the question
how many of theses supersymmetric flux vacua allow an uplift to dS via Kähler uplifting. Depending on the available values for the one-loop determinant from gaugino
condensation used to stabilize the Kähler moduli in this setup, we find that for a fraction of about 10−4 of all flux vacua up to a given D3-brane tadpole this mechanism
can be applied to obtain a dS vacuum.
For the minimal flux method, we find ∼ 1000 flux vacua with L < 500 out of ∼ 107
parameter points of our scan. This method allows us to control the region in W0 and
moduli space where we are intending to find flux vacua. Hence, we more easily access
the regions of weak string coupling and the large complex structure limit compared
to the polynomial homotopy continuation method. For the much smaller set of flux
vacua constructed with the minimal flux method, the fraction of Kähler uplifted dS
minima is about 10%.
