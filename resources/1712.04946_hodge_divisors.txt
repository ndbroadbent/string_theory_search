We prove a formula for the Hodge numbers of square-free divisors of Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Euclidean branes wrapping divisors affect the
vacuum structure of Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIB string theory, M-theory,
and F-theory. Determining the nonperturbative couplings due to Euclidean branes on
a divisor D requires counting fermion zero modes, which depend on the Hodge numbers hi (OD ). Suppose that X is a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface in a toric
variety V , and let D be the restriction to X of a square-free divisor of V . We give
a formula for hi (OD ) in terms of combinatorial data. Moreover, we construct a CW
complex PD such that hi (OD ) = hi (PD ). We describe an efficient algorithm that
makes possible for the first time the computation of sheaf cohomology for such divisors
at large h1,1 . As an illustration we compute the Hodge numbers of a class of divisors
in a threefold with h1,1 = 491. Our results are a step toward a systematic computation
of Euclidean brane superpotentials in Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.

Introduction

Compactifications of type IIB string theory on orientifolds of Calabi-Yau threefolds,
and of F-theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds, provide important classes of four-dimensional
effective theories with N = 1 supersymmetry. The vacuum structure of these theories depends on the potential for the Kähler moduli, which parameterize the sizes of
holomorphic submanifolds in the Calabi-Yau manifold. In particular, in lieu of a potential for the Kähler moduli, positive vacuum energy in four dimensions induces an
instability of the overall volume of the compactification, and therefore realistic particle
physics and cosmology require a computation of the Kähler moduli potential.
In principle a minimum of the Kähler moduli potential could be created by competition among purely perturbative corrections to the leading-order Kähler potential.
However, at present the best-understood constructions of metastable vacua require
contributions to the superpotential for the Kähler moduli [1–3]. Because of the nonrenormalization theorem, such terms are necessarily nonperturbative, resulting from
Euclidean branes wrapping cycles — in fact, divisors — in the compact space.1
An important goal is to determine which divisors in a Calabi-Yau threefold or
fourfold support nonperturbative superpotential terms from Euclidean branes. Witten
has shown [4] that Euclidean M5-branes on a smooth effective vertical divisor D of a
smooth Calabi-Yau fourfold Y give a nonvanishing contribution to the superpotential
whenever D is rigid, meaning that the Hodge numbers h0,i (D) = hi (D, OD ) = hi (OD )
obey
h0,0 (D) = 1 , h0,1 (D) = 0 , h0,2 (D) = 0 , h0,3 (D) = 0 ,
(1.1)
which we abbreviate as h• (OD ) = (1, 0, 0, 0). Rigidity corresponds to the absence
of massless bosonic deformations, and implies that the only zero modes of the Dirac
operator on the M5-brane are the two universal Goldstino modes that result from
the supersymmetries broken by the M5-brane. In more general circumstances — when
either D or Y is singular, when fluxes are included on D or in Y , or when D is a divisor
of a Calabi-Yau threefold — the conditions for a nonperturbative superpotential are
more subtle, but the Hodge numbers are still essential data.
For this reason, a long-term aim is to compute the Hodge numbers of effective
divisors D of Calabi-Yau manifolds X. This is most manageable in the case of smooth
Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties: for many years there have been computational algorithms and implementations for computing sheaf cohomology of coherent
sheaves on toric varieties [5–7], and there are faster implementations for computing sheaf cohomology of line bundles on toric varieties [8, 9]. Unfortunately, all of
these implementations fail to finish for even very modest sizes of h1,1 (X), say for
1

Strong gauge dynamics in four dimensions, arising on seven-branes wrapping four-cycles in the
compact space, is an alternative. The geometric requirements on such cycles closely parallel those in
the Euclidean brane case, and we will refer only to the latter in this work.

h1,1 (X) & 10 − 20. A key open problem in computational algebraic geometry is to find
algorithms that work for effective divisors or coherent sheaves on all Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces arising from the Kreuzer-Skarke database [10] of four-dimensional
reflexive polytopes, as well as for Calabi-Yau fourfold hypersurfaces in toric varieties.
We will not arrive at a fully general answer. However, in the important special
case in which X is a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface in a toric variety V ,
b on V , we will establish
and D is the restriction to X of a square-free effective divisor D
i
a formula for h (OD ) in terms of the combinatorial data of V . This formula, given in
Theorem 3, is our main result. As we will see, Theorem 3 allows one to read off the
Hodge numbers of many divisors by inspection, and moreover it is straightforward to
turn this formula into an algorithm that computes the Hodge numbers of any squarefree divisor of any X arising from the Kreuzer-Skarke database [11].
The principal tools in our proof are stratification; the hypercohomology spectral
sequence of the Mayor-Vietoris complex (3.2); and a correspondence that we establish
between square-free divisors of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface and CW complexes constructed on a triangulation of the associated reflexive polytope ∆◦ . Let us briefly
summarize these results. Stratification is the decomposition of an n-dimensional toric
variety V into tori, and leads to the extremely simple expressions (2.9) for the Hodge
numbers h0,i of particular subvarieties of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface X ⊂ V . Among
these subvarieties are prime toric divisors Di , i = 1, . . . h1,1 (X) + 4, each of which corresponds to a lattice point of a reflexive polytope ∆◦ , as we review in §2. The Hodge
numbers h• (ODi ) and the intersections of the prime toric divisors Di are fully specified
by elementary combinatorial data: namely, by the simplicial complex T corresponding
to a triangulation of ∆◦ , together with the number of lattice points interior to each
face of ∆.
A square-free divisor D is the union of a collection of distinct prime toric diviP
sors, D =
Di . In order to compute hi (OD ), one can appropriately combine the
data characterizing the constituent prime toric divisors Di ⊂ D. To achieve this, we
establish (in Appendix A) that the Mayer-Vietoris sheaf sequence associated to D is
exact, and we then examine the corresponding hypercohomology spectral sequence.
Formally, these methods are already sufficient to derive an expression for hi (OD ), but
we find it valuable to carry out the computation, and to express the result, in terms of
a particular CW complex P that encodes the data of T and ∆. The construction of
P amounts to attaching cells to each j-face Θ◦ of ∆◦ , in a manner determined by the
number of lattice points in the relative interior of the dual face Θ ⊂ ∆. A square-free
divisor D naturally determines a subcomplex PD ⊂ P, and via the hypercohomology
spectral sequence we are able to relate the sheaf cohomology of OD to the cellular
homology of the CW complex PD . In particular, we show that hi (OD ) = hi (PD ),
proving the theorem.
A subtlety in applying our results to compute Euclidean brane superpotentials is

3

P
that any nontrivial sum D =
Di of prime toric divisors Di that is rigid is necessarily
reducible, and involves normal crossing singularities where the Di intersect. Normal
crossing singularities present no obstacle to defining and computing hi (OD ), but they
do complicate the connection between hi (OD ) and the number of fermion zero modes:
new zero modes can appear at the intersection loci. Thus, the Hodge numbers hi (OD )
that we compute here mark a significant step toward computing the superpotential,
but do not provide a final answer. Systematically counting the fermion zero modes
associated to normal crossing singularities, along the lines of [12–14], is an important
problem for the future [15].
The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2 we set notation and recall
elementary properties of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Then, given any
square-free divisor D in a Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface, we define a corresponding
∆-complex RD and a CW complex PD , which are constructed so that their homology
encodes the sheaf cohomology of OD . In §3 we prove our main result, Theorem 3,
which asserts that hi (OD ) = hi (PD ). In §4 we illustrate our findings in the example
of a Calabi-Yau threefold with h1,1 = 491. We conclude in §5. Appendix A defines
Mayer-Vietoris complexes and proves some relevant properties. In Appendix B we
review key results from stratification. In Appendix C we directly compute h2 (OD ) by
counting lattice points in dual faces, for the special case where TD is restricted to a
single 2-face of ∆◦ .

Notation and Preliminaries

2.1

Polytopes and toric varieties

In this paper we consider Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces X in simplicial toric
varieties V , as studied by Batyrev in [16] (see also Appendix B for a review). Such
Calabi-Yau threefolds are constructed from pairs (∆, ∆◦ ) of four-dimensional polytopes
with vertices in Z4 , obeying
h∆, ∆◦ i ≥ −1 .
(2.1)
A pair of d-dimensional lattice polytopes obeying (2.1) is called a reflexive pair. In
each dimension, there are only a finite number of reflexive pairs, up to equivalence,
and those in dimension d ≤ 4 have all been enumerated [10, 17–19].
Given a four-dimensional reflexive polytope ∆◦ , we choose a fine star regular2
triangulation Tb of ∆◦ . Since each simplex in Tb contains the origin, this triangulation
determines a fan Σ, and V := PΣ is the corresponding simplicial toric variety. If F is
a generic linear combination of the monomials in the Cox ring of V that correspond to
Fine means that the triangulation uses all the lattice points of ∆◦ . A triangulation is star if
the origin, which is the unique interior point of a reflexive polytope ∆◦ , is contained in every fourdimensional simplex of Tb . Regularity is a condition that ensures that V , and hence X, is projective.

the lattice points of the polytope ∆, then X := {F = 0} ⊂ V is a smooth Calabi-Yau
threefold hypersurface in V [16]. The toric variety V in general has pointlike orbifold
singularities, but for generic F , X does not intersect these points, and is smooth.
We denote the set of faces of ∆◦ by F, the set of faces of dimension at most
j by F(≤ j), and the sets of vertices, edges, and 2-faces by F(0), F(1), and F(2),
respectively. For each face Θ◦ in F, there is a unique face Θ of ∆ defined by
hΘ◦ , Θi = −1 .

(2.2)

Given any face Θ ⊂ ∆, we denote by `∗ (Θ) the number of lattice points in the relative
interior of Θ. Given a face Θ◦ of ∆◦ , we define its genus g(Θ◦ ) by
g(Θ◦ ) := `∗ (Θ) ,

(2.3)

i.e. we define the genus of Θ◦ to be the number of interior lattice points of its dual
face.
If σ ∈ Tb is a simplex, we define the corresponding minimal face, minface(σ), to
be the lowest-dimensional face of ∆◦ containing all of the lattice points {pI | I ∈ σ}.
We define
µ(σ) := dim minface(σ)
(2.4)
and
g(σ) := g(minface(σ)) .
2.2

(2.5)

The Picard group of X

For each nonzero lattice point pI on ∆◦ there is an associated ray of the fan Σ and
a corresponding homogeneous coordinate zI of the toric variety V . We may hence
b I given by {zI = 0} with the point pI . This notion can
associate the toric divisor D
be extended to each d-simplex σ of the triangulation Tb by associating σ with the
subvariety Vσ := {zI = 0 ∀ pI ∈ σ}. Let Xσ := Vσ ∩ X be the intersection of Vσ with
the Calabi-Yau hypersurface X. This intersection is nonzero if and only if the simplex
σ is contained in a 2-face of ∆◦ . It is therefore useful to define
T := {σ ∈ Tb | µ(σ) ≤ 2} ,

(2.6)

which omits simplices of Tb that pass through facets (3-faces) of ∆◦ , and so correspond
to varieties that do not intersect a generic Calabi-Yau hypersurface X. In a slight
abuse of language, we refer to T as a triangulation.
The Hodge numbers of subvarieties Xσ ⊂ X are given by rather simple formulae
[20–22]. For the divisor DI of X associated with a lattice point σ = pI ∈ T we find

(2.7)

In particular, divisors associated with points interior to 2-faces Θ◦ with g(Θ◦ ) > 0
are reducible. A 1-simplex σ of T connecting a pair of lattice points pI and pJ in T
corresponds to the intersection CIJ := DI ∩ DJ , with Hodge numbers

(2.8)

That is, a curve C associated with a 1-simplex σ interior to a 1-face Θ◦ is irreducible,
of genus g(Θ◦ ). A curve C associated with a 1-simplex σ interior to a 2-face Θ◦ is a
union of g(Θ◦ ) + 1 disjoint P1 s. A 2-simplex σ of T containing three lattice points
pI , pJ , pK corresponds to the intersection of three divisors, and the corresponding Xσ
consists of 1 + g(σ) points.
The above results can be summarized as
h0,i (Xσ ) = δi,0 + δi,2−µ(σ) g(σ) .

(2.9)

This result easily generalizes to arbitrary dimension: see Appendix B.7. Moreover,
in Appendix B.6 we give similar, albeit slightly more complicated and triangulationdependent, formulae for the Hodge numbers h1,1 (Xσ ).
As shown in [16], the Hodge numbers of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface X obey simple
combinatorial relations as well. In particular, the rank of the Picard group of X satisfies
X
X
h1,1 (X) =
`∗ (Θ◦ ) − 4 +
`∗ (Θ◦ )`∗ (Θ)
(2.10)
Θ◦ ∈F (≤2)

Θ◦ ∈F (2)

We can identify N := h1,1 (X) + 4 divisors that obey four linear relations, and that
generate the Picard group of X. First of all, the K ≤ N divisors of X associated with
lattice points in F(≤ 1) are irreducible. However, the divisor associated with a lattice
point pr interior to a 2-face Θ◦ has 1 + g(Θ◦ ) irreducible, connected components, which
we denote Drα , α ∈ {0, . . . , g(Θ◦ )}. The N irreducible divisors

then generate the Picard group of X. These can be written collectively as {DIα } with

6

α ∈ {0, . . . , δµ(pI ),2 g(pI )}, but we will reindex them as as
Di ∈ {D1 , . . . , DN }.
We refer to the Di as prime toric divisors, even though the Drα do not all
descend from prime toric divisors on V unless X is favorable, i.e. unless g(Θ)g(Θ◦ ) =
0 ∀ Θ◦ ∈ F(2). By (2.7), a prime toric divisor Di associated with a lattice point σ has

h (ODi ) = 1, g(σ), 0



(2.12)

For any subset G ⊆ {1, . . . , N }, there is an associated divisor D (possibly reducible)
defined by
X
D=
Di .
(2.13)
i∈G

We call such a D a square-free divisor. The main purpose of this work is to analyze
square-free divisors.
2.3

The ravioli complex R

Every d-simplex of T contained in the relative interior of a face Θ◦ ∈ F(j) for j ≤ 2
gives rise to a closed subvariety Xσ ⊂ X, of complex dimension 2 − d. When j ≤ 1,
the simplices in T correspond to irreducible subvarieties of X. However, for j = 2,
i.e. when σ ∈ T is in the interior of a 2-face Θ◦ of ∆◦ , the simplex σ corresponds to a
subvariety of X that has 1 + g(Θ◦ ) connected (and irreducible) components, which we
denote by Xσα , for α = 0, . . . , g(σ).
The intersection structure of the Xσ is determined by ∆ and by the triangulation
T of ∆◦ . For each 2-face Θ◦ of ∆◦ , we can choose an ordering of α = 0, . . . , g(σ) such
that for any σ, λ ∈ T with minface(σ) = minface(λ) = Θ◦ , we have
Xσα ∩ Xλβ =

(
α
δ αβ Xσ∪λ
∅

if σ ∪ λ ∈ T ,
if σ ∪ λ ∈
/T .

(2.14)

Next, for each τ ∈ T with µ(τ ) ≤ 1, the intersection structure with the Xσα can
be written as
(
Xτα∪σ
if τ ∪ σ ∈ T ,
Xτ ∩ Xσα =
(2.15)
∅
if τ ∪ σ ∈
/T .

7

Finally, for τ, ω ∈ T , with µ(τ ) ≤ 1 and µ(ω) ≤ 1, we have:
Xτ ∩ X ω =

(
Xτ ∪ω

if τ ∪ ω ∈ T ,

∅

if τ ∪ ω ∈
/T .

(2.16)

In the special case of (2.16) in which τ ∪ ω ∈ T with minface(τ ∪ ω) = Θ◦ ∈ F(2), we
can write (2.16) as
g(Θ◦ )

X τ ∩ Xω =

[

Xτα∪ω .

(2.17)

α=0

We will now define a complex, called the ravioli complex R, that accounts for
the intersection structure (2.14)-(2.17). Recall that the simplices in T correspond to
subvarieties in X, which are possibly disconnected and reducible. The cells in R will
correspond to the connected, irreducible components of the subvarieties in X encoded
by T . The ravioli complex is defined by
n
o n
o
R = Xσα σ ∈ T , µ(σ) = 2, 0 ≤ α ≤ g(σ) ∪ Xτ τ ∈ T , µ(τ ) ≤ 1 ,
(2.18)
which as a set consists of the irreducible connected components of intersections of the
Di . The elements of R that have dimension 2 − i in X are called i-cells. For those
X such that3 g(Θ◦ ) = 0 ∀ Θ◦ ∈ F(2), R is the simplicial complex T . In the general
case, the i-cells of R are the same as the i-simplices of T , except that each simplex σ
in the interior of any two-dimensional face Θ◦ ∈ F(2) of ∆◦ is replaced by 1 + g(Θ◦ )
disjoint copies of itself, after which the (1-cell) boundaries of the 1 + g(Θ◦ ) disjoint
copies T |Θ◦ of are identified with each other.
In general R is not a simplicial complex, but instead a ∆-complex:4 the 1-cells
and 2-cells are not necessarily uniquely specified by the 0-cells that contain them (in
X). The homology and cohomology complexes of R are readily obtained, and the fact
that R is not always a simplicial complex does not present difficulties for computation
or visualization. The origin of the name should be clear from Figures 1 and 2.
We can now associate a ∆-complex RD ⊆ R to any square-free divisor D as
follows. The points of RD are the points (0-cells) pi in R corresponding to the divisors
appearing in (2.13). Some pairs (triples) of the pi may in general be connected by 1cells (2-cells) of the complex R. The pi , together with the set of all 1-cells and 2-cells
connecting them, therefore define a unique subcomplex RD ⊆ R. An example is shown
in the bottom image in Figure 1. The points in RD correspond to codimension-one
Notice that even in the case where X is favorable, i.e. obeying g(Θ)g(Θ◦ ) = 0 ∀ Θ◦ ∈ F(2), R is
not necessarily equal to T .
4
The term ∆-complex is standard in topology, and the symbol ∆ appearing in the name should
not be confused with the polytope ∆. See [23] for background on ∆-complexes and CW complexes.

The puff complex P

Let us briefly recapitulate. By (2.9), the sheaf cohomology of prime toric divisors and
their intersections is fully specified once one knows the simplicial complex T determined
by the triangulation T , together with the genera g(Θ◦ ) of the faces Θ◦ ∈ F(≤ 2). For
Θ◦ a 2-face, the number g(Θ◦ ) records the extent to which subvarieties corresponding
to simplices contained in Θ◦ are reducible. By promoting the simplicial complex T to
the ∆-complex R, we have encoded the information about reducibility directly in the
complex R. Heuristically, viewed as sets of data about subvarieties,

The next step is to account for the data of {g(Θ◦ )|Θ◦ ∈ F(≤ 1)}. In close analogy
to the promotion T → R, we now define a CW complex5 P that encodes this data.
Heuristically,

P ↔ T , g(Θ )|Θ ∈ F(≤ 2) ,
which is made precise by the following:
Definition 1 The puff complex P is a CW complex constructed from the ravioli
complex R as follows. For each vertex v and edge e in R, we have natural inclusions
v ,−
→ S 2 and e ,−
→ S 2 , where the latter inclusion induces a cellular structure on S 2 with
g(v)

The property of CW complexes that is relevant here is that a 2-cell or 1-cell σ can be attached
to the complex by a map that identifies the boundary ∂σ with a 0-cell in the complex.

Figure 3: The layers of the puff complex for a single face. The lower row shows the
three layers of P for the triangulated face at the top of the figure. In this example,
◦[1]
the genera of the various faces are such that g(Θ◦[2] ) = 1, g(Θi ) = (2, 1, 0) and
◦[0]
g(Θi ) = (1, 3, 0).

The CW complex PD associated to a divisor D is the sub-complex of P corresponding
to the image of RD under the morphism ϕ.
In other words, to construct PD , we attach a bouquet of g(v) two-spheres to each
vertex v ∈ G, a bouquet of g(p) circles to each point p ∈ G interior to an edge, and a
bouquet of cylinders S 1 × I to each connected component of RD restricted to e. These
spaces are glued together along their common points: in particular, the g(e) cylinders
over a complete edge e ⊂ RD are pinched down into the two vertices bounding e,
forming a collection of g(e) two-dimensional voids.
We will find it useful to divide the puff complex into layers:
Definition 2 For 0 ≤ j ≤ 2, the jth layer P (j) of the puff complex P is the subset
of P resulting from replacing points interior to each (2 − j)-face Θ◦ of ∆◦ with g(Θ◦ )
j-spheres, replacing 1-simplices interior to Θ◦ with g(Θ◦ ) cylinders S j × I, etc., as in
Definition 1. In particular, P (0) = R.
Figure 3 contains a sketch of the different layers of the puff complex for a simple
example.
The homology of PD is readily obtained. Distinct connected components of PD
can be examined separately, so we may take h0 (PD ) = 1 without loss of generality.
Contributions to h1 (PD ) come from
11

(a) One-cycles in RD .
(b) For each edge e ⊂ ∆◦ , a bouquet of g(p) cylinders over each connected component
of RD e that is strictly interior to e.
Contributions to h2 (PD ) come from
(c) Two-cycles in RD .
(d) The bouquet of g(e) pinched cylinders over each edge e such that RD e = e.
(e) The bouquet of g(v) two-spheres over each vertex v, i.e. the layer P (2) .
We will prove in §3.1 that these classes of contributions are in one-to-one correspondence with classes of contributions in the hypercohomology spectral sequence that
computes the cohomology of OD . In other words, the homology of the CW complex
PD encodes the cohomology of OD . As we will see, this correspondence has both
computational and heuristic utility.

Spectral Sequence Computation of Hodge Numbers

In this section we will prove our principal result:
P
Theorem 3 Let D =
i∈G Di , with G ⊆ {1, . . . , N }, be a square-free divisor, as
defined above. Denote by P and PD the puff complex and the associated subcomplex
determined by D, respectively. Then the Hodge numbers hi (OD ) are given by
hi (OD ) = hi (PD ) .

(3.1)

In the rest of this section, we prove Theorem 3. Our method is based on examining
a hypercohomology spectral sequence. We use stratification to identify the E 2 page
of that sequence, and then we use a somewhat indirect argument to show that the
differentials on the E 2 page are all zero.
3.1

Hypercohomology spectral sequence

To start, let {D1 , . . . , DN } be the prime toric divisors, as defined in §2. Given a
square-free toric divisor in X,
X
D :=
Di ,
i∈G

we will compute the cohomology h• (OD ). Suppose that we have indexed the Di so
P
that D = ri=1 Di , for some r ≤ N .

12

The set of divisors {D1 , . . . , Dr } is dimensionally transverse on a smooth variety,
and so by Proposition 20 of Appendix A, the generalized Mayer-Vietoris sequence

On this page, the differential δ 3 is zero.
The hypercohomology spectral sequence converges to the cohomology of OD ,
meaning that
dim H 0 (OD ) = dim ker β

(3.4)

dim H 1 (OD ) = dim ker ζ + dim(ker γ/ Im β)

(3.5)

dim H 2 (OD ) = dim H 2 (F0 ) + dim coker α + dim coker ζ

(3.6)

In the special case that ζ is the zero map, we have the simplifications
dim H 1 (OD ) = dim ker α + dim(ker γ/ Im β)

(3.7)

dim H 2 (OD ) = dim H 2 (F0 ) + dim coker α + dim coker γ

(3.8)

If the dependence on a divisor is understood, we denote the maps α, β, γ, ζ, while if
a divisor D is specified, we write α(D), etc.
3.2

Cohomology from stratification

We now use stratification to compute the cohomology organized by the spectral sequence given above.
Proposition 4 Row 0 of page 1 of the hypercohomology spectral sequence has coho(0)
mology equal to that of the ravioli complex RD = PD , that is:
dim ker β = dim H0 (RD )

(3.9)

dim(ker γ/ Im β) = dim H1 (RD )

(3.10)

dim coker γ = dim H2 (RD )

(3.11)

Note: this can be written more succinctly in the form
(0)

2
dim Ep,0
(D) = dim Hp (PD ) ,

(3.12)

2
for all p, even though dim Ep,0
(D) can only be nonzero for p = 0, 1, or 2.

Proof. We will identify row 0 of page 1 of the spectral sequence with the cohomology
complex of the complex RD . In the following, we will take RD (k) to be the set of kfaces of RD . In particular, RD (0) is the set of 0-dimensional faces (i.e. the Di ), RD (1)
14

is the set of 1-dimensional faces, i.e. one for each connected component of a Di ∩ Dj .
The same connected component C cannot occur for two different such intersections,
as otherwise the component C would be contained in the intersection of three or four
of the Di , which cannot happen since the Di are dimensionally transverse. Finally,
RD (2) corresponds to the points in each of the triple intersections of three divisors,
Di ∩ Dj ∩ Dk . Again, each point can only appear in one such intersection. Notice that
RD is a Delta complex whose cohomology sequence is
0 −→

where the maps δa are as follows: if C is a connected component of Di ∩ Dj , for i < j,
(δ0 (eDi ))C = −1 and (δ0 (eDj ))C = 1, and all other components are zero. If C is an
irreducible component of Di ∩ Dj , and if P is a point of the intersection Di ∩ Dj ∩ Dk ,
(for i < j), then
(δ1 (eC ))P = sign(i, j, k).
Now consider the complex of row 0 in page 1 of the spectral sequence. We see

and the complex (3.13) have the same terms. Under this identification, it is easy to
see that the maps are identical too, as the morphisms β and γ are canonically induced
by the generalized Mayer-Vietoris complex. 
Proposition 4 generalizes to all rows of the second page:
Proposition 5 For all p and q,
(q)

2
dim Ep,q
(D) = dim Hp+q (PD ).

Proof. We have already established the case q = 0. For q = 2, we note that stratification gives h2 (ODi ) = 0, unless Di corresponds to a vertex of ∆◦ having positive genus
g(v). Summing these gives
X
dim H 2 (F0 ) =
g(v) ,
(3.14)
v∈F (0)
v∈D

proving Proposition 5 for q = 2.
The case q = 1 can be established by noting that row 1 of page 1 of the spectral
sequence, because of stratification, breaks up into a direct sum of complexes, summed
15

over all edges e in ∆◦ intersecting D:

M
M
Cg(e) ⊗ 0 −→


C −→

τ ∈TD∩e (0),τ ∈∂e
/

e∈F (1)

M

C −→ 0

(3.15)

τ ∈TD∩e (1)

The complex in parentheses is simply the relative cochain complex for the pair (TD∩e , TD∩∂e ).
Note that because e is an edge, (TD∩e , TD∩∂e ) = (RD∩e , RD∩∂e ).
Therefore the p-th cohomology (for p = 0, 1) of the direct sum of complexes
L
(3.15) is the relative cohomology e Cg(e) ⊗ H p (RD∩e , RD∩∂e ), which is the same as
L g(e)
(1)
⊗ Hp (RD∩e , RD∩∂e ), which by the definition of P equals Hp+1 (PD ). 
eC
2
(D) then
Corollary 6 Given a square-free divisor D, if ζ(D) = δ0,1→2,0

3.3

ζ(D) = 0 ⇐⇒ dim H i (OD ) = dim Hi (PD ) for all i

(3.16)

⇐⇒ dim H 1 (OD ) = dim H1 (PD )

(3.17)

⇐⇒ dim H 2 (OD ) = dim H2 (PD ) .

(3.18)

Proof that ζ = 0

In this section we will prove the following, which also, by Corollary 6, proves Theorem 3.
Lemma 7 If D corresponds to a square-free divisor on X, then the map
2
ζ(D) = δ0,1→2,0
(D)

is the zero map.
We prove this result by first splitting D = A + B1 + . . . + Bm , where A and the Bi
are all square-free divisors having disjoint support. Consider the subgraph TD (≤ 1).
Suppose that this graph has m components each of which is contained in the strict
interior of an edge of ∆◦ . Let Bi be the sum of the divisors corresponding to the
lattice points in the ith component. Let A be the sum of the rest of the divisors.
P
Define Aj := A + ji=1 Bi , with A0 = A and Am = D.
Lemma 8 The map ζ(A) is zero, and so dim H i (OA ) = dim Hi (PA ).
(1)

2
Proof. The map is zero, because its domain, E0,1
(A), which has dimension dim H1 (PA ),
is zero by construction. 

Lemma 9 dim H 2 (OBi ) = 0.
Proof. If the given component Bi consists of divisors associated to lattice points
interior to an edge of genus g, then h• (OBi ) = (1, g, 0). 
16

Lemma 10 Fix an integer 1 ≤ i ≤ m, and let C := Ai−1 ∩ Bi . Then C is a curve
whose irreducible components are all P1 ’s, two intersect in at most one point, and
H 1 (OC ) = 0.
Proof. C := Ai−1 ∩ Bi is a collection of rational curves C = ∪M CM . As a complex, C
corresponds to a collection of 1-simplices σM , each with one end in RBi , and the other
end in an edge not containing RBi , in a 2-face, or in a vertex. Two curves CM and CN
intersect if and only if σM and σN share a 2-simplex σM,N .
Now notice that h1 (OC ) 6= 0 is possible only if the CM intersect in such a way as
to form a nontrivial loop. But this would require a closed loop in which three or more
1-simplices σ1 , . . . , σK are connected by 2-simplices σ1,2 , . . . , σK−1,K , σK,1 . However,
because RBi is in the strict interior of an edge, no such loop can be formed. Thus,
h1 (OC ) = 0. 
Lemma 11 dim H 2 (OA ) = dim H 2 (OD ).
Proof. We prove this by induction. Consider Ai = Ai−1 + Bi , where A0 = A. We use
induction to show that dim H 2 (OA ) = dim H 2 (OAi ), for i = 0, . . . , m. The statement
is trivial for i = 0, and for i > 0, we use the long exact sequence associated to the
Mayer-Vietoris sequence
0 −→ OAi −→ OAi−1 ⊕ OBi −→ OC −→ 0.
combined with Lemmas 9 and 10. One obtains that H 2 (OAi ) = H 2 (OAi−1 ). 
Lemma 12 dim H 2 (PA ) = dim H 2 (PD ).
Proof. There are four cases where an element of H 2 can appear: D contains a vertex
of genus > 0, D contains an entire edge of genus > 0, D contains at least two full
sheets over a 2-face, and finally, D contains a collection of full 2-faces that contain a
void. Since by definition, not all of the lattice points of the edge containing Bi are in
D, and Bi contains no vertices, PA and PD must have the same H 2 . 
Proof of Lemma 7, and therefore also the proof of Theorem 3. Lemmas 8,
11, and 12 imply that
dim H 2 (PD ) = dim H 2 (PA ) = dim H 2 (OA ) = dim H 2 (OD ),
and so by Corollary 6, we have ζ(D) = 0, proving the theorem. 

3.4

Generalization to Calabi-Yau n-folds

Most aspects of the computation above generalize immediately to Calabi-Yau n-folds.
Definition 13 Let V be a simplicial toric variety of dimension n + 1, and let X
be a smooth Calabi-Yau n-fold hypersurface in V , with Nn := h1,1 (X) + n + 1. Let
P
D = i∈G Di , with G ⊆ {1, . . . , Nn }, be a square-free divisor. The construction of
Definition 1 generalizes to any n ≥ 3, and we denote by P and PD the puff complex
and the associated subcomplex determined by D, respectively.
We note that the constructions of P and PD are immediate because our results on
the stratification of subvarieties Xσ ⊂ X apply for any n.
Next, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence generalizing (3.2) contains n+1 nonzero terms.
The resulting hypercohomology spectral sequence again converges to the cohomology
of OD , and it is easy to see that row zero of page one of the hypercohomology spectral
sequence again has cohomology equal to that of RD . Moreover, Proposition 5 holds
for arbitrary n [15]. However, for n > 3 there are more diagonal maps, generalizing ζ.
If for every n the diagonal maps were shown to be identically zero, as we have
proved in the case n = 3, then we would have hi (OD ) = hi (PD ) for all n. However,
examining the diagonal maps directly in the same manner as done for ζ in §3.3 would
be somewhat involved. We defer a proper analysis of these maps to [15], and state
here only the following:
Conjecture 14 Let V , X, D, and PD be as in Definition 13, and set n = 4. For
each such D there exists k(D) ∈ Z≥0 such that
h• (OD ) = h• (PD ) − (0, k(D), k(D), 0) .

(3.19)

We show in [15] that k(D) = 0 for all D except those obeying a rather restrictive
condition.

Interpretation and an Example

We will now briefly discuss the interpretation of our result, and then illustrate the
utility of our formula in an example.
4.1

Contractible graphs

Equation 3.1 depends on only certain topological properties of the complex PD , and
so two complexes that correspond to divisors that are related to one another by deformations that preserve these topological properties will have identical Hodge numbers.
This leads to a useful tool in enumerating certain divisors, as we now explain.

18

Given a triangulation T and the associated simplicial complex T , a square-free
divisor D determines a unique simplicial complex TD ⊂ T , as well as a corresponding
CW complex PD ⊂ P. The number N of distinct square-free divisors of a given
1,1
puff complex P that corresponds to a Calabi-Yau hypersurface X is 2h (X)+4 . Thus,
the task of working out the Hodge numbers of all possible square-free divisors appears
formidable for large h1,1 (X). Fortunately, as we will now explain, Theorem 3 implies
that square-free divisors fall into equivalence classes.
Suppose that we begin with a set of lattice points G1 ⊂ {1, . . . , N }, which define
a square-free divisor D1 and a CW complex PG1 . Now let us add or remove one lattice
point from G1 , so that G1 is changed to some G2 ⊂ {1, . . . , N }. This operation uniquely
defines a new square-free divisor D2 and a new CW complex PG2 . By Equation (3.1),
if hi (PG1 ) = hi (PG2 ) then hi (OD1 ) = hi (OD2 ).
We define a single contraction to be the operation of changing D1 → D2 by
adding or removing a lattice point, as specified above, in such a way that hi (PD1 ) =
hi (PD2 ). We define a contraction to be an arbitrary composition of single contractions. Contraction is an equivalence relation on square-free divisors, and all members
of a contraction equivalence class have the same Hodge numbers. However, two divisors with the same Hodge numbers do not necessarily belong to the same contraction
equivalence class.
As an example consider the complex in Figure 4, with associated divisor D =
D1 + D2 + D3 , where the Di correspond to the points pi . Equation 3.1 gives h• (OD ) =
(1 + g(f ), 0, 0), where f is the 2-face containing G. We can perform a contraction by,
for example, first deleting p2 , and then deleting p3 , as in Figure 4. We will present a
more involved example in §4.2.

Example with h1,1 = 491

As a demonstration of the utility of Theorem 3 we will now calculate the Hodge numbers of some nontrivial divisors in a Calabi-Yau hypersurface X in a toric variety
corresponding to a fine, star, regular triangulation of the largest polytope ∆◦L in the
Kreuzer-Skarke database [10]. In this example, ∆◦L is the convex hull of the columns

There are 679 nonzero lattice points in ∆◦ , but 184 of these are interior to 3-faces,
and therefore do not intersect X. X has h1,1 (X) = 491, with 495 toric divisors. The
face structure is very simple: ∆◦L is a 4-simplex, with vertices indexed by {0,1,2,3,4},
corresponding to the columns of B. There are 5 vertices, 10 edges, and 10 triangles in
∆◦L , before triangulation. The genera of all the faces are given in Table 1.
Consider the largest 2-face f` in ∆◦L , which is a triangle with vertices labeled
by {0, 1, 2}. This face has 344 lattice points, as shown in Figure 5. All (sub)faces

except vertex 2 have genus 0, and so the puff complex P restricted to f` is simply
T restricted to f` , with a single S 2 cell attached to vertex 2. If we choose, excluding
point 2, a set of points on f` whose corresponding complex is connected and has no
cycles, then the corresponding divisor will be rigid. The divisor corresponding to
the entire face has Hodge numbers (1, 0, 1). The divisor corresponding to the line
connecting 2 to 4 has Hodge numbers (1, 0, 9). As a more nontrivial example we can
form simplicial complexes with cycles on f` and ∆◦L . The complex defined by taking
all the boundary points of f` , and none of the interior points, defines a divisor with
Hodge numbers (1, 1, 1). In Figure 5 we show a triangulation6 of f` , and a choice of a
more complicated subcomplex containing cycles. Theorem 3 allows us to easily read
off the Hodge numbers of the corresponding divisor D as h• (OD ) = (1, 9, 1).

This triangulation of f` is for illustrative purposes; the triangulation we have obtained from a
regular triangulation of ∆◦L is difficult to render.

just restricted to a single 2-face, as depicted in Figure 6. Here we show a facet of ∆◦L

indicate lattice points included in the complex, and the red lines cycle-free paths that
may include additional lattice points. The red triangles indicate entire faces that are
included in the complex. Note that the point 1, corresponding to (−1, −1, −1, 83),

entire boundary of the facet. From Theorem 3 we can immediately read off the Hodge
numbers of the corresponding divisors as h• (ODa ) = (1, 0, 0), h• (ODb ) = (1, 1, 3),
h• (ODc ) = (1, 0, 5), and h• (ODd ) = (1, 0, 6).

Conclusions

In this work we have computed the Hodge numbers hi (OD ) of square-free divisors D
of Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Given the data of a simplicial
complex T corresponding to a triangulation of a four-dimensional reflexive polytope
∆◦ , we constructed a CW complex P that simultaneously encodes data about ∆◦
and its dual ∆. The construction of P involves attaching certain cells to T in a
manner determined by ∆. The specification of a square-free divisor D determines a
subcomplex PD , as well as an exact Mayer-Vietoris sheaf sequence. By examining the
corresponding hypercohomology spectral sequence, we proved that hi (OD ) = hi (PD ).
Here the left-hand side is manifestly the dimension of a sheaf cohomology group, but
the right-hand side is the dimension of a simplicial (or cellular) homology group.
Our results are a step forward in the study of divisors in Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.
Theorem 3 permits extremely efficient computation of the Hodge numbers of squarefree divisors in threefolds, even for h1,1  1. Conjecture 14 extends these methods to
fourfolds, enlarging the range of divisors with computable Hodge numbers [15].
The ultimate goal of this work was to determine which effective divisors D of a
Calabi-Yau hypersurface support Euclidean brane superpotential terms. Theorem 3
represents significant progress toward this goal, but further advances will be necessary
to give a completely general answer. First of all, although the Hodge numbers hi (OD )
provide essential information about the number of fermion zero modes of a Euclidean
brane on D, when D is not smooth there can be additional zero modes associated to
singular loci. The only smooth, rigid, square-free divisors are the prime toric divisors
Di themselves; a nontrivial square-free divisor that is rigid necessarily involves normal
crossing singularities where the components Di intersect. One should therefore ask
how to count fermion zero modes on a divisor with normal crossings. In some cases,
normal crossings can be shown to yield no new fermion zero modes, so that rigidity is
a sufficient condition for a superpotential [15]. Moreover, there exist nontrivial smooth
square-free divisors D with Hodge numbers h• (OD ) = (1, 0, n), with n > 0. In a
suitably magnetized Euclidean D3-brane wrapping such a divisor, worldvolume flux
can lift the zero modes counted by h2 (OD ), and so lead to a superpotential term, even
though D is not rigid. Finally, Donagi and Wijnholt have proposed that in general
the fermion zero modes can be counted by the logarithmic cohomology of D, h•log (OD )
[12]. Verifying and applying this idea is a natural task for the future.
There are many possible extensions of this work. The effects of worldvolume flux
could plausibly be incorporated along the lines of [24], but including the effects of
bulk fluxes appears more challenging. A further step would be to compute the Hodge
numbers of effective divisors that are not square-free. Advances in these directions
would allow for a truly systematic computation of the nonperturbative superpotential
for the Kähler moduli in compactifications on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.

Mayer-Vietoris Complexes

In this section we establish the exactness of the generalized Mayer-Vietoris sequence,
and we give related background on spectral sequences.
Given closed subvarieties (or subschemes) D and E of a variety (or scheme) X,
the Mayer-Vietoris complex is
0 −→ OD∪E −→ OD ⊕ OE −→ OD∩E −→ 0

(A.1)

This is always an exact sequence, and one can view it as an inclusion-exclusion sequence. If I and J are ideals in a ring R, then we have the related exact sequences:
0 −→ R/I ∩ J −→ R/I ⊕ R/J −→ R/(I + J) −→ 0

(A.2)

0 −→ I ∩ J −→ I ⊕ J −→ I + J −→ 0.

(A.3)

and
There are well-known generalizations of these sequences to the cases where there are
more than two subvarieties, ideals, or quotients, but at this level of generality the
resulting Mayer-Vietoris sequence is often not exact. We will now prove exactness for
several cases of interest in this paper.
We start with the case of ideals. Suppose that I1 , . . . , In ⊂ R are ideals in a
ring R. Define the Mayer-Vietoris ideal sequence, M = M(I1 , . . . , In ), to be the
cochain complex
0 −→ (I1 ∩ . . . ∩ In ) −→ M 0 −→ M 1 −→ . . . −→ M n−1 −→ 0,

(A.4)

where
M p :=

M

(Ii0 + . . . + Iip )

1≤i0 <...<ip ≤n

and the differential dp : M p −→ M p+1 is defined by
p

(d (φ))i0 ...ip+1 =

p+1
X

(−1)j φi0 ...îj ...ip+1

j=0

One checks immediately that ker(d0 ) = I1 ∩ . . . ∩ In , and that the sequence (A.4) is
in fact a complex. Notice that if Ii = R for all i, then M(R, . . . , R) is the (reduced)
cochain complex of an (n − 1)-simplex, and so is exact.
The Mayer-Vietoris quotient complex, M(R/I1 , . . . , R/In ) is the cochain
complex defined in a completely analogous manner:
0 −→ R/(I1 ∩ . . . ∩ In ) −→ N 0 −→ N 1 −→ . . . −→ N n−1 −→ 0,

25

(A.5)

where
M

N p :=

R/(Ii0 + . . . + Iip )

1≤i0 <...<ip ≤n

and the differential (dN )p : N p −→ N p+1 is defined by the natural quotient maps
p+1
X
(−1)j φi0 ...îj ...ip+1
((d ) (φ))i0 ...ip+1 =
N p

j=0

Again, one checks that (A.5) is a complex, and that ker(dN )0 = R/(I1 ∩. . .∩In ). There
is an exact sequence of complexes
0 −→ M(I1 , . . . , In ) −→ M(R, . . . , R) −→ M(R/I1 , . . . , R/In ) −→ 0,
and coupled with the exactness of the middle complex, the complex M(I1 , . . . , In ) is
exact precisely when M(R/I1 , . . . , R/In ) is exact.
Finally, given closed subvarieties (or subschemes) D := D1 ∪ . . . ∪ Dn of a variety
(or scheme) X, we define the Mayer-Vietoris sheaf sequence M(D1 , . . . , Dn ) in
parallel to the above, taking
M
M(D1 , . . . , Dn )p :=
ODi0 ∩Di1 ∩...∩Dip .
1≤i0 <i1 <...<ip ≤n

Define maps dp : M(D1 , . . . Dn )p −→ M(D1 , . . . , Dn )p+1 in the same manner as for
quotients of ideals above. The resulting complex M(D1 , . . . , Dn ) has the form

Distributive lattices of ideals and Mayer-Vietoris complexes of ideals

The relationship between distributive lattices of ideals and the exactness of MayerVietoris ideal sequences was explained in [25]. In this section, we summarize their
results, and then show that several sets of ideals of interest form distributive lattices,
so that their Mayer-Vietoris sequences are exact. This is the key technical fact that
will allow us to show in §A.2 that certain Mayer-Vietoris complexes of sheaves are
exact.
Fix a (commutative) ring R and ideals J1 , . . . , Jr of R. This set of ideals generates
a lattice of ideals: the join of two ideals is their sum, and the meet of two ideals is their
intersection. The smallest set of ideals that contains J1 , . . . , Jr and is closed under
these two operations is the lattice of ideals generated by J1 , . . . , Jr .
This lattice of ideals is called distributive if for every three ideals L1 , L2 , L3 in the

26

lattice, one has
L1 ∩ (L2 + L3 ) = (L1 ∩ L2 ) + (L1 ∩ L3 ).
Equivalently, the lattice is distributive if and only if for every three ideals L1 , L2 , L3 in
the lattice, one has
L1 + (L2 ∩ L3 ) = (L1 + L2 ) ∩ (L1 + L3 ).
The importance of this notion is the following useful characterization due to
Maszczyk.
Theorem 15 (Maszczyk [25]) For a set of ideals J1 , . . . , Jn of a ring R, the following are equivalent:
(a) The lattice of ideals generated by J1 , . . . , Jn is distributive.
(b) M(J1 , . . . , Jn ) is exact, and hence so is M(R/J1 , . . . , R/Jn ).
The following is a typical distributive lattice of ideals:
Example 16 Let S = C[x1 , . . . , xn ] be a polynomial ring over a field F. Then the
lattice of ideals generated by {(x1 ), . . . , (xn )} is the set of square-free monomial ideals
of S. This is a distributive lattice of ideals.
A square-free monomial ideal M ⊂ F[x1 , . . . , xn ] has a unique description as an
irredundant intersection of monomial prime ideals
\
hxi | i ∈ αi,
M=
α∈Λ

where the intersection is over a uniquely defined set of subsets of [1..n]. The ideals in
the intersection are the minimal primes of M .
A key example is a generalization of this to the case where F = {f1 , . . . , fn } ⊂ R
is a regular sequence. We will only consider the case where R is a local ring, or a
graded ring, and in these cases any permutation of the fi remains a regular sequence.
Given F = {f1 , . . . , fn } ⊂ R, define a map φ : Z[x1 , . . . , xn ] −→ R, where
φ(xi ) = fi . In this section, we call an ideal I ⊂ R an F -square-free ideal if there is a
square-free monomial ideal M such that I is generated by φ(M ), i.e., I is generated by
square-free products of the fi . We will say that I is an F -square-free monomial ideal
if it is F -square-free, and I can be written as the intersection
\
I=
hfi | i ∈ αi,
α∈Λ

where
M=

\

hxi | i ∈ αi.

α∈Λ

27

Theorem 17 Let F = {f1 , . . . , fn } be a regular sequence in the maximal ideal of a
local ring R.
(a) The lattice of ideals generated by (f1 ), . . . , (fn ) is exactly the set of F -squarefree ideals.
(b) This lattice of ideals is distributive.
This follows from the following more precise lemma, which we prove by induction
on n.
Lemma 18 Let F = {f1 , . . . , fn } be a regular sequence. Let F 0 := {f1 , . . . , fn−1 }.
The following statements hold.
(a) If J is an F 0 -square-free ideal, then (J : fn ) = J.
(b) If Ii , Ji are F 0 -square-free ideals, then L1 = I1 fn + I2 and L2 = J1 fn + J2 obey
L1 ∩ L2 = (I1 ∩ J1 + I1 ∩ J2 + I2 ∩ J1 )fn + I2 ∩ J2 .
(c) If I and J are F 0 -square-free ideals, then
((fn ) + I) ∩ ((fn ) + J) = ((fn ) + (I ∩ J)).
(d) If I and J are F 0 -square-free ideals, then
(Ifn + J) : fn = I + J.
(e) Every F -square-free ideal is an F -square-free monomial ideal.
(f ) If L1 and L2 are F -square-free ideals, then L1 ∩ L2 is also F -square-free.
(g) If L1 , L2 , L3 are F -square-free ideals, then
L1 ∩ (L2 + L3 ) = L1 ∩ L2 + L1 ∩ L3 .
Proof. We prove this by induction. The case n = 2 is immediate. Suppose the
statements are true for a number of elements of F less than n.
(a) By part (e) in the induction hypothesis,
\
J=
hfi | i ∈ αi,
α∈Λ

where all the fi that appear have i < n. Then J : fn is the intersection of
hfi | i ∈ αi : fn = hfi | i ∈ αi,
whose intersection is again J.

28

(b) The right hand side is clearly contained in the left hand side, so let γ =
α1 fn + α2 = β1 fn + β2 ∈ L1 ∩ L2 . One shows that γ is contained in the right hand
side (where α1 ∈ I1 , α2 ∈ I2 , β1 ∈ J1 , β2 ∈ J2 ). Thus, (α1 − β1 )fn = β2 − α2 ∈ I2 + J2 .
Therefore, by part (a), since I2 +J2 is F 0 -square-free, α1 −β1 ∈ I2 +J2 . Therefore, there
exists δ1 ∈ I2 , δ2 ∈ J2 such that α1 − β1 = δ1 − δ2 . Now plug this back into the formula
for γ to get δ1 fn + α2 = δ2 fn + β2 ∈ I2 ∩ J2 . Since this is already in the right hand side,
we can subtract it from γ, obtaining an element γ 0 = (α1 −δ1 )fn = (β1 −δ2 )fn that is in
the right hand side precisely when γ is. Since fn is a nonzero divisor, α1 − δ1 = β1 − δ2 ,
so γ 0 ∈ ((I1 + I2 ) ∩ (J1 + J2 ))fn . Combining this with the induction hypothesis of
part(g), we have that (I1 + I2 ) ∩ (J1 + J2 ) = I1 ∩ J1 + I1 ∩ J2 + I2 ∩ J1 + I2 ∩ J2 , and
therefore γ 0 , and hence γ, is contained in the right hand side.
(c) This follows immediately from (b), by taking I1 = J1 = R.
(d) This follows immediately from (b): (Ifn + J) ∩ (fn ) = (I + J)fn , and so
(Ifn + J) : fn = I + J.
(e) For any ideal I, and f ∈ R, such that I : f 2 = I : f , we always have
I = (I : f ) ∩ ((f ) + I). Let L = Ifn + J be an F -square-free ideal. If I = 0, then
the inductive hypothesis gives that L = J is F 0 -square-free monomial, and is therefore
F -square-free. If instead, fn ∈ L, then the induction hypothesis gives a decomposition
for J, and part (c) gives the required decomposition for L. Otherwise, by part (d) we
have L = (I + J) ∩ ((fn ) + J). Both of these have decompositions, by (e) (for n − 1)
and (c), and putting them together gives a decomposition for L.
(f) This follows immediately from (b) and the inductive hypothesis for (f).
(g) This follows immediately from part (b). 
Proof of Theorem 17. The set of F -square-free ideals is plainly closed under addition
of ideals. By Lemma 18(b), the lattice of ideals generated by (f1 ), . . . , (fn ) contains
the set of F -square-free ideals. Also by Lemma 18(f), the set of F -square-free ideals is
closed under intersection, and so the lattice of ideals generated by (f1 ), . . . , (fn ) is the
set of F -square-free ideals. Finally, by Lemma 18(g), the lattice is distributive. 
A.2

Mayer-Vietoris sequences corresponding to divisors and curves

Recall that D ⊂ X is called a prime divisor on X if it is irreducible and codimension
one in X.
Proposition 19 If X is a simplicial toric variety, and D1 , . . . , Dr are prime torusinvariant Weil divisors on X, then the Mayer-Vietoris sheaf sequence M(D1 , . . . , Dr )
is an exact sequence of OX -modules.
Proof. Let S = C[x1 , . . . , xN ] be the Cox ring of X, where Di corresponds to the ring
variable xi , for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Consider the Mayer-Vietoris ideal sequence M(x1 , . . . , xr ).
This is exact, as the xi generate a distributive lattice, and so M(S/x1 , . . . , S/xr ) is also
29

exact. Sheafification of this exact sequence of graded S-modules remains exact, but
this sheafification is precisely M(D1 , . . . , Dr ). 
Proposition 20 If X is a smooth variety, and D1 , . . . , Dr are effective divisors, such
that the intersection of each set of n of these is either empty, or has codimension n
in X, then the Mayer-Vietoris sheaf sequence M(D1 , . . . , Dr ) is an exact sequence of
OX -modules.
Proof. We prove exactness locally. Let p ∈ X be a point. Suppose that the set of Di
that pass through p is {D1 , . . . , Dn }. Localizing the Mayer-Vietoris sheaf complex at p
results in the complex M(R/f1 , . . . , R/fn ), where R = OX,p , and the Cartier divisor Di
is defined locally in this ring by fi . Note that, by hypothesis, the elements f1 , . . . , fn
form a regular sequence in the maximal ideal of R. Therefore, Theorem 17 shows
that M(f1 , . . . , fn ) is exact. This implies that M(R/f1 , . . . , R/fn ) is also exact, which
implies that the original complex is exact at each p ∈ X, proving the proposition. 
Notice that this proof can be generalized to the case when X is equidimensional,
not necessarily smooth, and the Di are Cartier divisors with the given intersection
properties.
There also exists a corresponding exact sequence in the case of curves simply using the
corresponding normalization without necessitating the above technology.
Lemma 21 Suppose X is a smooth, projective variety and assume that C1 , . . . , Cr
are smooth, irreducible curves on X, and that the corresponding closed subscheme
C := C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr is a nodal, reducible curve with components Ci . Then the MayerVietoris sequence M(C1 , . . . , Cr ) is an exact sequence of OX -modules.
Proof. By hypothesis, the normalization f : C̃ → C is the scheme corresponding to
the disjoint union of the smooth, irreducible components Ci . Thus, the normalization
induces the following short exact sequence
M
M
O Ci  f ∗
OCi /OC ,
(A.7)

where the quotient sheaf is a torsion sheaf with support precisely on the nodes of C.
By considering the sequence locally at the nodes, we thus obtain the following exact
sequence of OC -modules

where g is the natural closed immersion and pj correspond to the nodes of C. Higher
direct images of closed immersions vanish and hence we obtain an exact sequence of
OX -modules yielding exactness of M(C1 , ..., Cr ). 

Background on spectral sequences

We will now highlight the essential aspects of hypercohomology spectral sequences
needed to follow the computation of h• (OD ). We begin by describing the basic usage
of the two spectral sequences corresponding to a double complex. Instead of going into
detail about filtrations, we assume that the entries of the second and subsequent pages
of the spectral sequence are finite-dimensional vector spaces. We are describing “first
quadrant” spectral sequences, as that is what we need for hypercohomology.
We start with a bounded double complex of vector spaces, C = {C p,q , dh , dv },
i.e. a collection of vector spaces C p,q , where C p,q = 0 outside of the box 0 ≤ p ≤ M ,
p,q
0 ≤ q ≤ M , for some M , horizontal differentials dp,q
−→ C p+1,q , and vertical
h : C
differentials dp,q
: C p,q −→ C p,q+1 satisfying d2h = d2v = 0, and the compatibility
v
condition that they anticommute: dh dv = −dv dh . More generally, we could allow C p,q
to be modules, or objects in some Abelian category, and the maps would then be
morphisms in this category.
There are two spectral sequences corresponding to C, 0 Erp,q and 00 Erp,q . We will
describe the first, from which the second is easily obtained. A spectral sequence is a set
of pages Erp,q , for r = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Each page is a two-dimensional array of vector spaces
Erp,q , for 0 ≤ p, q ≤ M , together with a map dr . The zeroth page, E0 , starts with C p,q
p,q
p,q
−→ C p,q+1 .
in the (p, q) spot, and the map is the vertical differential dp,q
0 := dv : C
The differential dr at each step satisfies the equation d2r = 0, and maps
p,q
p+r,q−r+1
dp,q
.
r : Er −→ Er

The first page is obtained from the zeroth page by setting
p,q−1
E1p,q := ker dp,q
).
0 / Im(d0

The differential d1 is simply the horizontal map
p,q
p+1,q
dp,q
1 : E1 −→ E1

induced by the horizontal differential on C. In general, given the r-th page of the
spectral sequence, the (r + 1)-st page is the array
p,q
p−r,q+r−1
Er+1
:= ker dp,q
).
r / Im(dr

By iterating this procedure, the spectral sequence eventually converges when all terms
on the page stabilize. For a first quadrant spectral sequence, the spectral sequence
converges to the cohomology of the total complex
E2p,q =⇒ H p+q (Tot(C))

31

where the total complex is a complex with the n-th term defined by
M
Tot(C)n =
C p,q
p+q=n

with the natural differential defined by d = dv + dh .
A.4

The hypercohomology spectral sequence

We now explain the utility of the spectral sequence discussed above in computing sheaf
cohomology. Let us fix a smooth complex projective variety X and closed subvarieties
D1 , . . . , Dn . We assume that the intersection of each set of k of the Di is either empty,
or has codimension k in X, so that by Proposition 20 the corresponding Mayer-Vietoris
sheaf sequence M(D1 , . . . , Dn ) is an exact sequence.
Let {OD } denote a complex localized in degree 0 with the term OD and let
Ln
{ i=1 ODi −→ . . . −→ OD1 ∩...∩Dn } denote the corresponding complex beginning in
degree 0. These complexes are quasi-isomorphic and hence, as objects in the bounded
derived category Db (X), they are isomorphic. We have the natural global sections
functor Γ : Qcoh(X) → Vec(C), and by deriving on the right and restricting to the full
subcategory of bounded complexes of quasicoherent sheaves with coherent cohomology, we obtain the induced derived functor RΓ : Db (X) → Db (Vec(C)). For a given
complex of coherent sheaves F • , we then compute the hypercohomology groups, or
higher derived functors, by taking cohomology, namely H i (X, F • ) = H i RΓ(F • ).
In order to compute the hypercohomology groups of a complex F • , we take a
quasi-isomorphic complex of injective objects given by f : F • → I • and compute the
cohomology H i (Γ(I • )). Such a complex is often constructed as the total complex
of the Cartan-Eilenberg resolution J •,• of F • where existence is proved by applying
the horseshoe lemma. In particular, the hypercohomology H(F • ) is independent of the
resolution. However, in practice, injective resolutions are usually hard to find explicitly,
and so one often resorts to taking acyclic resolutions.

Stratification of Toric Hypersurfaces and Hodge Numbers
of Strata

In this appendix we will review a number of results about the stratification of toric
varieties and the associated stratification of hypersurfaces. In particular, we will review
how the algorithm of [26] can be used to conveniently read off the Hodge numbers of
toric strata. Although all of these techniques are in principle well-known, a succinct
exposition, especially in the physics literature, is lacking. We refer the reader to [27–
29] for an introduction to toric geometry. The original reference for how to compute
Hodge numbers of toric strata for hypersurfaces is [26]; see [16, 20, 21] for a number
of applications close to physics.
B.1

Toric varieties and stratification

By definition, a toric variety V is characterized as containing an open dense algebraic
torus, (C∗ )n , the action of which (on itself) extends to the whole variety. One can
think of an n-dimensional toric variety as a (partial) compactification of (C∗ )n in
which various lower-dimensional algebraic tori are added. These can be thought of as
‘limits’ of the original (C∗ )n , so that the action of (C∗ )n on itself extends naturally to
the whole variety.
This structure can be summarized by a combinatorial object called a fan. A fan Σ
is a collection of strongly convex rational polyhedral cones such that the face of every
cone counts as a cone in the fan and two cones only intersect along a face of each.
Here, strong convexity demands that no subspace (except the origin) of the ambient
vector space is contained in any cone. One can think of each cone as being spanned
by a finite number of rays with primitive generators vi that are elements of a lattice
N . Finally, we (mostly) make the further assumption that every cone is simplicial, i.e.
any d-dimensional cone is spanned by d rays. In this case the associated toric variety
has at most orbifold singularities and is factorial.
Let us label the (generators of the) rays of Σ by vi , with the index i running from
1 to r. The toric variety PΣ associated with the fan Σ can then be described in analogy
to complex projective space by associating a homogeneous coordinate zi to each ray of
the fan and forming the quotient
Cr − SR
PΣ =
.
G

(B.1)

This data is encoded in the fan as follows. First, the exceptional set or Stanley Reisner
ideal, SR corresponds to all collections {vi |i ∈ I} for which the cones vi do not share
a common higher-dimensional cone. Wheneve this is the case, the set SR contains the
subspace of Cr in which the associated collection of coordinates {zi |i ∈ I} vanishes

simultaneously. The Abelian group G is given as the kernel of the homomorphism
Y he ,v i
zi → tk =

(B.2)
j

where the ek form a basis of the lattice M . Note that this implies that whenever there
is a linear relation
X
ai v i = 0 ,
(B.3)
i

there is an associated one-parameter subgroup C∗ ∈ G which acts as
(z1 , · · · , zr ) ∼ (λa1 z1 , · · · , λar zr )

(B.4)

for λ ∈ C∗ . In most cases of interest, G can be completely described through relations
like this. In general, however, G may contain discrete factors. Note that the above
discussion implies that the (complex) dimension of V equals the (real) dimension of N .
In the following, we also use the notation PΣ to denote the toric variety determined by
the fan Σ.
For all zi 6= 0, the coordinates tk defined in (B.2) parameterize the open dense
∗ n
(C ) giving the toric variety its name. The strata that are added to turn (C∗ )n into a
nontrivial toric variety are encoded in the fan as follows. We first associate the unique
zero-dimensional cone σ [0] , i.e. the origin, of Σ with (C∗ )n . Each d-dimensional cone
[d]
σi is naturally associated with the homogeneous coordinates zi corresponding to its
generating rays. Choosing the basis ek in (B.2) from lattice vectors contained in the
dual cone
hσ̌, σi ≥ 0 ,
(B.5)
which sits in σ̌ ∈ M ⊗ R, where M is the dual lattice to N , we may take a limit of
(B.2) where we set the zi = 0 for all vi generating σ. As a d-dimensional cone σ [d] has
d generators, this lands us on an n − d-dimensional algebraic torus Tσ[d] ≃ (C∗ )n−d and
the definition of a fan ensures that all of these strata are consistently sewn together.
Denoting the set of d-dimensional cones by
[d]

Σ(d) = {σk } ,

(B.6)

we can hence stratify any toric variety according to the data of our fan as

setting
{zi = 0 ∀vi ∈ σ}

and

{zi 6= 0 ∀vi ∈

(B.8)

Let us discuss some examples. The fan corresponding to P1 lives in R and is
composed of three cones: the origin, a ray generated by 1 and a ray generated by −1.
We recover the standard presentation from (B.1) as
P1 =

(z1 , z2 ) − {(0, 0)}
.
(z1 , z2 ) ∼ (λz1 , λz2 )

(B.9)

The open dense C∗ can be described by the coordinate z1 /z2 , or equivalently by z2 /z1 ,
and the strata corresponding to the two one-dimensional cones are simply given by
z1 = 0 and z2 = 0, respectively. We hence recover the description of P as the Riemann
sphere, i.e. adding the point at infinity to C.
The fan corresponding to P2 is shown in figure 7. Again, (B.1) gives the standard
presentation as
(z1 , z2 , z3 ) − {(0, 0, 0)}
P2 =

In the bulk of this paper we are not interested in the geometry of toric varieties
per se, but rather in the geometry of algebraic subvarieties. In the simplest setting,
such an algebraic subvariety Z is given as the vanishing locus of a section of a line
bundle L on V . For such an algebraic subvariety Z, one easily obtains a stratification
of Z from that of V if all toric strata meet Z transversely. In this case we can define
an n − d − 1-dimensional stratum
Zσ[d] = Z ∩ Tσ[d]

(B.12)

for every d-dimensional cone σ [d] ∈ Σ. The stratification of the hypersurface Z is then
simply

Zσ[d] .

Let us illustrate this in the simple example of hypersurface of degree k in P2 , i.e.
we consider the vanishing locus of a homogeneous polynomial Pk (z1 , z2 , z3 ) of degree k
in the homogeneous coordinates of P2 . Call the resulting curve Ck . By adjunction one
finds that such a hypersurface is a Riemann surface of genus
g(k) =

(k − 1)(k − 2)
.
2

(B.14)

Let us now see how Ck is stratified using (B.13). First consider the lowest dimensional
strata of P2 , which correspond to the highest-dimensional cones. Each of the three
two-dimensional cones of the fan of P2 corresponds to a point on P2 that is defined by
setting two of the three homogeneous coordinates to zero. For a sufficiently generic
polynomial Pk , such points will never lie on Z, so that these strata do not contribute
to Z (indeed they are supposed to be 2 − 2 − 1 = −1-dimensional). For each of the
three one-dimensional cones in the fan of P2 , there is a stratum C∗ obtained by setting
one of the three homogeneous coordinates to zero while forbidding the remaining two
from vanishing. Intersecting this with Pk = 0 we find that Zσ[1] consists of k points for
every one-dimensional cone σ [1] . Finally, the complex one-dimensional stratum Zσ[0] is
a Riemann surface of genus g(k) with 3 · k points excised. Below, we will show how to
reproduce these numbers combinatorially by using the Newton polytope of Pk .
B.2

Toric varieties and divisors from polytopes

In order to describe how to determine the geometry of strata Zσ[d] combinatorially, we
need to present the situation of interest from a slightly different perspective. Note first
that the data defining the topology of Z consists of the toric variety V (or, equivalently,
the fan Σ) and a line bundle L on V . We can write the divisor class D of L in terms

36

of the toric divisors Di corresponding to rays of Σ as
X
D = c1 (L) =
ai Di .

(B.15)

i

The group of holomorphic sections of L is then given by a polytope ∆, known as the
Newton polytope, defined by
PD = {m ∈ M | hm, vi i ≥ −ai ∀ vi } .
More explicitly, we may use the monomials
Y hm,v i+a
p(m) =
zi i i

(B.16)

(B.17)

i

as a basis for the group of sections. This provides a convenient way to find the zeroth
cohomology group (which is in fact the only non-vanishing one) of a divisor D (line
bundle L), as this counts global holomorphic sections of L:
h0 (PΣ , OPΣ (D)) = |PD ∩ M | .

(B.18)

Interestingly, ∆ determines both the line bundle L and (a blowdown of) the toric
variety V . To any polytope ∆ in the M -lattice, we can associate its normal fan Σn (∆),
which then gives rise to a toric variety PΣn (∆) along with a divisor D. This works as
follows. To every face Θ[k] of the polytope ∆, we associate a cone
[
σ̌n (Θ[k] ) =
r · (p∆ − pΘ[k] )
(B.19)
r≥0
[k]

where p∆ is any point lying inside ∆ and pΘ is any point lying inside Θ[k] . The dual
cones σn (Θ[k] ) (defined as in (B.5)) form a complete fan that is called the normal
fan Σn (∆) of ∆. Here, k-dimensional faces Θ[k] of ∆ are associated with d = n − kdimensional cones σn (Θ[k] ). In particular, the cones of Σ(∆) of highest dimension are
associated with the vertices of ∆.
On the toric variety PΣn (∆) , the polytope ∆ then determines a line bundle (Cartier
divisor) via a strongly convex support function ψ∆ . For each cone of maximal dimension of Σn (∆), Ψ∆ can be described by using its dual vertex mi and setting
Ψ∆ |σn (mi ) (p) = hmi , pi

(B.20)

for each point p in σn (mi ). This also determines Ψ∆ for all cones of lower dimension.

37

The divisor
D∆ =

X

ai Di

(B.21)

νi ∈Σn (1)

can then be determined from
Ψ∆ |σn (mi ) (νi ) = −ai ∀νi ∈ σn (mi ) .

(B.22)

With the numbers ai we can recover a basis for the sections of the line bundle L via
(B.17).
The above relations can be used to associate a cone-wise linear support function
ΨD to any divisor D. If the line bundle associated to D is ample, ΨD is strongly convex
(i.e. it is convex and different for each cone of maximal dimension). A toric variety is
projective iff its fan is the normal fan of a lattice polytope [30].
Let us come back to the example of P2 and a hypersurface Ck determined by
Pk = 0. We may write
[Pk ] = kD3 .
(B.23)
in terms of toric divisors, so that a1 = a2 = 0 and a3 = k. As shown in figure 7, the
one-dimensional cones of Σ are generated by the vectors v1 = (1, 0), v2 = (0, 1), v3 =
(−1, −1). The Newton polytope ∆k corresponding to Pk = 0 has vertices
(k, 0), (0, k), (0, 0)

(B.24)

and its integral points correspond to all monomials of homogeneity degree k by using
(B.17). In particular
h(k,0),(1,0)i h(k,0),(0,1)i h(k,0),(−1,−1)i+k

= z1k ,

p((k, 0)) = z1

B.3

p((0, k)) = z2k ,

p((0, 0)) = z3k
(B.25)

Resolution of singularities

As there is a one-to-one correspondence between faces of ∆ and cones of Σn (∆), we
may write the stratification (B.13) in terms of faces of ∆ instead of cones of Σn (∆):
aa
Z=
ZΘ[k] .
(B.26)
i

k Θ[k]
i

As faces of dimension k correspond to cones of dimension d = n − k, the dimension
of these strata is n − d − 1 = k − 1. Note that ∆ counts as a face of itself, which
corresponds to the zero-dimensional cone of Σn (∆). We will discuss in Appendix B.4
how to determine the topology of the strata ZΘ[k] appearing above from the Newton
i
polytope.

38

What we have ignored so far, however, is that the normal fan Σn (∆) in most
cases (contrary to our simple example) does not give rise to a smooth toric variety. In
fact, the fan Σn (∆) does not even need to be simplicial.7 We are hence interested in
a refinement Σ of the fan Σn (∆) in order to resolve the hypersurface Z. Fortunately,
this process results in only minor modifications of the stratification (B.26) above.
In a slight abuse of notation, we will use the same letter Z also for the resolved
hypersurface. Under a refinement π : Σ → Σ(∆), the stratification associated with
faces of ∆ becomes:
a

Z = Z∆

associated with the face Θ[n−k] , there is a corresponding stratum (C∗ )k−l in EΘ[n−k] .
B.4

Computing Hodge-Deligne numbers of strata

In order to compute the Hodge numbers of toric hypersurfaces and, more generally,
toric strata in such hypersurfaces, we need to introduce a further piece of machinery. The strata appearing in the stratification (B.27) naturally carry a mixed Hodge
structure. In very simple terms, this means that the Hodge-Deligne numbers
hp,q (H k (X, C))

(B.29)

can be nonzero even when p + q 6= k, see e.g. [31, 32] for a proper introduction.
These data can be packed into the numbers (which we will also call Hodge-Deligne
numbers in the following)
X
ep,q (X) =
(−1)k hp,q (H k (X, C)) ,
(B.30)
k

which are convenient for a number of reasons. First of all, in case these is a pure
Hodge structure, they agree (up to a sign) with the usual Hodge numbers. Secondly,
they behave in the same way as the topological Euler characteristic under unions and
7

A fan is simplicial if all of its d-dimensional cones are generated by d rays. Fans that are not
simplicial give rise to toric varieties with singularities that are more general than orbifold singularities.
In particular, not every Weil divisor is Q-Cartier for such varieties.

p1 +p2 =p
q1 +q2 =q

Hence knowing the numbers ep,q (ZΘ[k] ) (and of (C∗ )n ) is sufficient to compute the
Hodge numbers of a toric hypersurface. This information has been supplied (in the
form of an algorithm) in the work of [26]. Before reviewing their algorithm, let us first
discuss toric varieties themselves to illustrate the method. We have that

(B.33)

For a smooth toric variety V , we hence see that hp,0 = 0 for p > 0. A direct consequence
of this formula combined with the stratification of a toric variety read off from its fan is
the standard formula [30] for the nontrivial Hodge numbers of a smooth n-dimensional
toric variety. Letting |Σ(l)| denote the number of l-dimensional cones in Σ we can
write

where `∗ (Θ[p+1] ) counts the number of lattice points in the relative interior of Θ[p+1]
and the sum runs over all faces Θ[p+1] of dimension p + 1 contained in the face Θ[k] .
Note that this sum only has one term for p + 1 = k which corresponds to the face Θ[k]
itself.

By subsequent application of these formulae, one can derive combinatorial formulae for the Hodge-Deligne numbers of strata ZΘ[k] for arbitrarily high k. It is convenient
to use `n (Θ) to denote the number of points on the n-skeleton of Θ. Let us derive the
Hodge-Deligne numbers ep,q of strata ZΘ[k] for k ≤ 3. First,

e0,0 (ZΘ[k] ) = (−1)k−1 `1 (Θ[k] ) − 1 ,

(B.40)

so that e0,0 (ZΘ[1] ) = `∗ (Θ[1] ) + 1, i.e. the stratum ZΘ[1] consists of `∗ (Θ[1] ) + 1 points.
Hence

Let us return to the example of a degree k hypersurface in P2 . The stratification
of P2 has already been discussed in §B.1, see (B.11), and its Newton polytope ∆k is

41

given in (B.24). The open dense torus (C∗ )2 in P2 gives rise to an open dense subset
of Ck , i.e. a Riemann surface with a number of points excised. Its Hodge-Deligne

B.5

Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and reflexive polytopes

Let us now come back to our prime interest, which is in Calabi-Yau manifolds. We
assume that the dimension of the vector space N ⊗ R containing the fan Σ is n, so that
we get an n-dimensional toric variety PΣ in which we want to embedd a Calabi-Yau
hypersurface of dimension n − 1.
In order for a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its defining polynomial must be a
section of the anticanonical bundle −KPΣ . The corresponding divisor is hence given
by
X
D−K = c1 (PΣ ) =
Di .
(B.47)
νi ∈Σ(1)

In the notation of (B.2), we hence have ai = 1 for all i and we can identify sections of
−KPΣ with the set of lattice points on the polytope
∆ ≡ {m ∈ M |hm, νi ≥ −1 ∀ν ∈ Σ(1)} ⊂ M ⊗ R.

(B.48)

A general section of −KPΣ , the zero locus of which defines a Calabi-Yau hypersurface,
is then given by
X
X Y
hm,ν i+1
αm zi i
αm p(m) =
(B.49)
m

m∈∆ νi ∈Σ(1)

for complex constants αm .
In general, the vertices of the polytope ∆ are not lattice points of M and we are
not guaranteed that a generic section of −KPΣ defines a smooth (or even irreducible)
Calabi-Yau hypersurface. If all of the vertices of ∆ are contained in M (in which case
we will call ∆ a lattice polytope), it follows that the vertices νi are all sitting on a

42

lattice polytope ∆◦ , defined by
h∆, ∆◦ i ≥ −1 .

(B.50)

∆◦ is called the polar dual of ∆, and ∆ and ∆◦ are called a reflexive pair [16] if they are
both lattice polytopes. Any lattice polytope whose polar dual is also a lattice polytope
is called reflexive. A necessary condition for reflexivity is that the origin is the unique
interior point of the polytope in question.
Repeating the construction of §B.2, Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties
are naturally constructed from reflexive pairs of lattice polytopes ∆, ∆◦ . Starting from
a lattice polytope ∆, we may construct its normal fan Σn (∆). In the case of a reflexive
pair, this is equal to the fan over the faces of ∆◦ . Of course, such a fan does not in
general define a smooth toric variety. In fact, the cones need not even be simplicial.
However, there is a natural maximal projective crepant partial (MPCP) desingularization that can be found as follows. Using (B.49), it follows that any refinement of the
fan Σn (∆) that only introduces rays generated by lattice points ν on ∆◦ is crepant,
i.e. preserves the Calabi-Yau property. We may hence find a MPCP desingularization
by a fan refinement Σ → Σn (∆) for which all lattice points νi on ∆◦ are employed and
for which PΣ is a projective toric variety. This is equivalent to finding a fine regular star
triangulation T of ∆. Here, fine means that all lattice points of ∆◦ are used, and star
means that every simplex contains the origin as a vertex.8 Projectivity of a toric variety is equivalent to its fan being the normal fan of a lattice polytope. While the toric
variety PΣn (∆) is projective by construction, this is not necessarily true for a refinement
Σ → Σn (∆). Triangulations T for which the associated fan Σ(T ) is the normal fan of a
polytope are called regular (or projective, coherent) in the literature, see [33] for more
details. Finally, a fine triangulation is in general not sufficient to completely resolve9
all singularities of PΣn (∆) meeting a generic Calabi-Yau hypersurface of dimension ≥ 4
[16]. The reason for this is that having a fine triangulation of a 2-face of a reflexive
polytope implies that the corresponding cones do not lead to any singularities. The
first dimension in which singularities can persist even for fine triangulations of a reflexive polytope is n = 5, i.e. Calabi-Yau fourfolds. For Calabi-Yau threefolds we are
considering four-dimensional polytopes. Here, simplices in 3-faces can lead to pointlike
singularities of the ambient toric variety even for fine triangulations, but these do not
meet a generic Calabi-Yau hypersurface. In contrast, the four-dimensional cones associated with three-simplices for five-dimensional polytopes lead to singularities along
curves which may meet a generic Calabi-Yau fourfold hypersurface.
The simplices of the triangulations are hence the cones of the fan Σ, cut off at the surface of ∆◦ .
Note that one may start from any triangulation T of ∆◦ , restrict it to a triangulation T∂∆◦ of the
faces of ∆◦ and then simply construct the cones over T∂∆◦ .
9
Of course, we can always find non-crepant resolutions by introducing rays generated by lattice
points outside of ∆◦ .
8

43

For a pair of n-dimensional reflexive polytopes, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the faces Θ[k] of ∆ and the faces Θ◦[n−k−1] of ∆◦ defined by
hΘ[k] , Θ◦[n−k−1] i = −1 .

(B.51)
[k]

Under the resolution induced by the refinement Σ → Σn (∆), the stratum ZΘ of a
Calabi-Yau hypersurface, which corresponds to a (k − 1)-dimensional subvariety of Z
before resolution, is changed according to the new simplices introduced in the dual
face Θ◦[n−k−1] . A simplex of dimension l (a cone of dimension l + 1) corresponds to a
subvariety of Z of dimension n−l −2. Hence a simplex of dimension l that is contained
in the interior of a face Θ◦[n−k−1] corresponds to a subvariety of the form
ZΘ[k] × (C∗ )n−l−k−1 .

(B.52)

Note that vertices Θ[0] of ∆, which are dual to the faces Θ◦[n−1] of maximal dimension,
correspond to −1-dimensional varieties, i.e. they do not contribute in the stratification
of Z. This persists after the resolution Σ → Σn (∆). A simple intersection argument
shows that none of the divisors corresponding to points ν interior to a face of maximal
dimension (and hence none of the other strata corresponding to simplices interior to a
face of maximal dimension) intersect a smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface. For any face
of maximal dimension (also called a facet) Θ◦[n−1] we can find a normal vector n (this
is the dual vertex Θ[0] ) such that hn, Θ◦[n−1] i = −1. This means that there is a linear
relation of the form
X
X
Di +
aj D j = 0 ,
(B.53)
νi ∈Θ◦[n−1]

νj ∈Θ
/ ◦[n−1]

for some integers aj . Let us now assume we have refined Σ such that there is a point
νp interior to the facet Θ◦[n−1] . The associated divisor Dp can only have a nonzero
intersection with divisors Dk for which νk also lies in Θ◦[n−1] , as all others necessarily
lie in different cones of the fan Σ. This means that the above relation implies
X
Dp ·
Di = 0 ,
(B.54)
νi ∈Θ◦[n−1]

where we sum over all toric divisors coming from points on Θ◦[n−1] . The Calabi-Yau

hypersurface is given as the zero locus of a section of −KPnΣ = j Dj , where we sum
over all toric divisors. We now find

X

Dj = Dp ·

(B.55)

νi ∈Θ◦[n−1]

by using the same argument again. Hence Dp does not meet a generic Calabi-Yau
hypersurface. Correspondingly, a refinement of Σ introducing νp does not have any

44

influence on Z. As the strata corresponding to simplices of dimension ≥ 1 interior to
Θ◦[n−1] can be thought of as (an open subset of) intersections of divisors, at least one of
which corresponds to an interior point of Θ◦[n−1] , none of the simplices interior to a face
of maximal dimension gives rise to any subvariety of PΣ meeting Z. Correspondingly,
such strata do not appear in the stratification of Z. The fact that all simplices contained
in faces of maximal dimension of ∆◦ do not contribute to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces
means that we can ignore such faces when constructing a triangulation of ∆◦ .
Using the methods explained above, one can derive combinatorial formulas for
the Hodge numbers of toric Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces [16] that do not depend on the
specific triangulation chosen. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface of dimension n − 1 which
is embedded in a toric variety of dimension n we have to consider a pair of reflexive
polytopes of dimension n and stratification gives

(Θ◦[n−m−1] ,Θ[m] )

Note that these numbers only make sense for a smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface, which
is only guaranteed without further investigation for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces of dimension ≤ 3.
Although the above formulas for h1,1 (Z) and hn−2,1 (Z) are derived using the
stratification technique of [26], they have a straightforward explanation. In particular,
the formula for hn−2,1 (Z) counts the number of complex structure deformations by
counting the number of monomial deformations appearing in the defining equation and
subtracting the dimension of the automorphism group of PΣ . Finally, the last term
in (B.57) corrects for the fact that not all deformations are realized as polynomial
deformations. Similarly, the formula for h1,1 (Z) counts the number of inequivalent
divisors of PΣ that meet Z, with a correction term taking into account that some
divisors of PΣ become reducible on Z.
As is apparent from the above formulae, exchanging the roles of ∆ and ∆◦ exchanges h1,1 (Z) ↔ h2,1 (Z). This is how mirror symmetry is realized for toric CalabiYau hypersurfaces.
B.6

Topology of subvarieties of Calabi-Yau threefolds

In this section we describe the topology of subvarieties of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in
toric varieties that are obtained by restricting toric subvarieties of the ambient space.

45

For ease of notation we restrict to the case n = 4, i.e. Calabi-Yau threefolds, but a
similar analysis may be carried out in higher dimensions. As we have already explained,
we only need to consider simplices on the 2-skeleton of ∆◦ , as strata of PΣ associated
with simplices interior to 3-faces of ∆◦ do not meet a smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
Each l-simplex of a triangulation T of ∆◦ corresponds to a l+1-dimensional cone in the
fan Σ and hence to an open stratum (C∗ )4−(l+1) in PΣ . Depending on the location of the
simplex on ∆◦ , the defining equation of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface will only constrain
some of the C∗ factors, while others will lie entirely in the Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
The reason for this is in the resolution process Σ → Σn (∆). If we work with the
singular varieties determined by Σn (∆), every k-dimensional face Θ◦[k] of ∆◦ gives rise
to a stratum ZΘ[4−k−1] of dimension 2 − k. This stratum is given as a hypersurface in
(C∗ )3−k . The resolution process Σ → Σn (∆), described in Appendix B.3, yields
ZΘ[4−k−1] → ZΘ[4−k−1] × EΘ[4−k−1] .

(B.59)

The factor EΘ[4−k−1] is determined by the simplices contained in the relative interior
of the face Θ◦[k] . Every l-simplex contained in the relative interior of a k-dimensional
face Θ◦[k] contributes a (C∗ )k−l to EΘ[4−k−1] , and hence it contributes a stratum
ZΘ[4−k−1] × (C∗ )k−l

(B.60)

to Z. Note that the factor ZΘ[3−k] is common to all of the strata originating from
simplices contained in a chosen face. For a Calabi-Yau threefold, this correspondence
is such that ZΘ is a two-dimensional variety for vertices, a curve for strata interior to
2-faces and a collection of points for strata interior to two-dimensional faces.
The closed subvarieties of PΣ , and hence of Z, associated with a simplex t are
found by collecting all lower-dimensional simplices u attached to t (i.e. t ⊂ ∂u) and
taking the disjoint union of the associated strata. As the Hodge-Deligne numbers ep,q
are additive, this provides an efficient way to find the Hodge numbers of the associated
subvariety. Again, we may neglect all simplices that are contained in the relative
interior of faces of maximal dimension (three in this case) as these do not contribute
any strata to a Calabi-Yau hypersurface. In the following, we will explicitly write down
the resulting stratifications of various subvarieties and compute their Hodge numbers.
At this point, we will adopt a different notation than in the rest of this appendix.
As in the main text of the paper, we focus on threefolds, and so only need to distinguish
vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces (facets) of ∆◦ , which we denote by v, e, f and c,
respectively. These are dual to 3-faces, 2-faces, edges and vertices on the M -lattice
polytope ∆, which are consequently denoted by v ◦ , e◦ , f ◦ and c◦ . We hope this does
not confuse the reader.

46

B.6.1

Vertices

Let us consider a divisor Di for which the associated lattice point νi = v is a vertex. The
vertex has a dual face v ◦ on ∆ that contributes an open two-dimensional stratum Zv◦ .
Furthermore, there will be 1-simplices contained in edges e (dual to faces e◦ ) ending on
v contributing Ze◦ as well as 1-simplices on 2-faces f (dual to 1-faces f ◦ ) contributing
Zf ◦ × C∗ . Finally there are 2-simplices on faces f (dual to 1-faces f ◦ ) contributing
Zf ◦ . Hence such divisors contain the irreducible hypersurface Zv◦ as an open dense set
that is compactified by the other strata. Note that Zf ◦ is just a collection of `∗ (f ◦ ) + 1
points.
Collecting all of these strata we find the stratification of Di to be

Finally, we can compute h1,1 (Di ). Here, we find a contribution from Zv◦ , computed in (B.43), as well as a contribution

Simplices interior to 1-faces of ∆◦

Let us first consider divisors originating from points νi interior to edges e of ∆◦ dual to
2-faces e◦ of ∆. The 0-simplex corresponding to νi is of the form Ze◦ × C∗ , and the two
1-simplices on the edge e containing νi correspond to Ze◦ . One-simplices containing νi
that are interior to 2-faces f (dual to f ◦ ) contribute `∗ (f ◦ ) + 1 points times C∗ and
2-simplices contribute `∗ (f ◦ ) + 1 points.
The open and dense stratum of such divisors (which originates from the simplex
νi ) is simply the product of a curve of genus `∗ (e◦ ) (with `1 (e◦ ) points excised) times
a C∗ , which gets compactified by the remaining strata. We may think of these as (the
open dense subsets of) the intersection of Di with ‘neighboring’ divisors. The two
1-simplices along the edge e partially compactify Ze◦ × C∗ to Ze◦ × P1 . The remaining
C∗ ’s and points sit over the `1 (e◦ ) points excised in the open curve Ze◦ . We may hence
think of such divisors as follows: they are flat fibrations of a P1 over a curve of genus
`∗ (e◦ ). Over `1 (e◦ ) points, the fiber P1 degenerates into a chain of P1 ’s, as determined
by number of 1-simplices (and 2-simplices) attached to νi lying on neighboring 2-faces
f ⊃ v. To see the details of how this works first note that
X
`∗ (f ◦ ) + 1 .
(B.67)
`1 (e◦ ) =
f ◦ ⊂e◦

Over each of the `∗ (f ◦ ) + 1 points that are excised due to the face f ◦ ⊂ e◦ , we find the
strata corresponding to the one- (and two-) simplices interior to the dual face f ⊃ e.
Hence over `∗ (f ◦ ) + 1 points, where f ◦ , f are dual faces, the generic fiber P1 of Di
degenerates into a number of P’s equal to the number of 1-simplices which attached to
νi and interior to f . A cartoon of this is shown in figure 8.
From this analysis of the fibration structure, we expect that

h1,1 (Di ) = 2 +

which will be confirmed by a direct computation using the stratification below.
As explained above, the stratification of Di is

curve and the generic fiber is a P1 . For each neighboring 2-face f ⊃ e, there are
1 + `∗ (f ◦ ) points over which the fiber degenerates into as many P1 s as there are 1simplices t1 on f that contain νi .

to the two 1-simplices on e containing νi (k = 2, l = 2). Each C∗ multiplying Zf ◦
corresponds to a 1-simplex containing νi that is interior to the face f and each pt
corresponds to a 2-simplex containing νi that is interior to f .
Again, h0,0 (Di ) = 1 as Di is irreducible. The computation for h1,0 now becomes
h1,0 (Di ) = −e1,0 (Ze◦ · (C∗ q 2pts))
= `∗ (e◦ ) · (e0,0 (C∗ ) + 2e0,0 (pt))

(B.70)

= `∗ (e◦ ) .
We have h2,0 (Di ) = e2,0 (Di ) = 0 as no stratum contributes. Already for the highest
stratum Ze◦ , we have to count interior points to 3-dimensional faces of e◦ , of which
there are none. These Hodge numbers fit with the fibration structure discussed above.

49

Finally, let us compute h1,1 (Di ). Here we need


as predicted from the analysis of the fibration of Di carried out above.
Similarly, one may analyze curves C that correspond to 1-simplices t1 interior to
a 1-face e. Here, the stratification is
X
Zf◦ × (pt) .
(B.72)
C = Ze◦ +
f ◦ ⊂e◦

The stratum Ze◦ is a curve of genus `∗ (e◦ ) with a number of points excised. The second
term is due to the unique 2-simplex attached to t1 on every face f ⊃ e, which consists
of `∗ (f ) + 1 points for each two-dimensional face containing e. It supplies the points
that compactify Ze◦ to C. It follows immediately that the genus of C is
h1,0 (C) = `∗ (e◦ ) .

(B.73)

This fits with the fact that the union of all strata corresponding to simplices in the
interior of e sits over the curve C, so that two neighboring divisors Di and Dj intersect
in the common base of both their fibrations.
B.6.3

Simplices interior to 2-faces of ∆◦

Again, let us first consider 0-simplices νi interior to a 2-face f of ∆◦ . The open dense
subset of Di originating from νi is given by
Zf ◦ × (C∗ )2 ,

50

(B.74)

while 1-simplices (2-simplices) containing νi compactify Di this by contributing Zf ◦ ×C∗
and Zf ◦ × (pts). All in all, the stratification of Di is

where t1 and t2 are simplices interior to f . As Zf ◦ is just a collection of `∗ (f ◦ )+1 points,
the divisors considered here are, in general, reducible with each irreducible component
being a toric variety Pstar(νi ) determined by the stratification above. Starting from the
triangulation of a 2-face, we may construct the star fan w.r.t. νi to find the fan of the
toric variety Pstar(νi ) , see figure 9.

Similarly, the closed subvariety associated with each 1-simplex interior to f is
` (f ) + 1 times a P1 and the closed subvariety associated with each 2-simplex consists
of `∗ (f ◦ ) + 1 points. This implies that any two (three) divisors associated with points

As remarked above, some of the Hodge numbers will depend on the triangulation. Let
us choose the triangulation shown in the upper left of figure 10. The divisors D1 , D4
and D7 correspond to vertices, so that we conclude h1,0 vanishes for all three and
h2,0 (D1 ) = `∗ (v1◦ ) = 0
h2,0 (D4 ) = `∗ (v4◦ ) = 4

(B.85)

h2,0 (D7 ) = `∗ (v2◦ ) = 54
no matter which triangulation is chosen. Let us now compute the Hodge numbers h1,1
for the triangulation in the upper left of Figure 10, for which we have to evaluate

Note that there are no other 1-faces except e2 and e7 , both of which are on f6 , with
interior points and all 2-faces of ∆◦ are simplicial. Hence there can be no other 1simplices except the ones in f6 , shown in Figure 10, which contain ν1 , ν4 or ν7 and are
interior to a 2-face. Furthermore, `∗ (f6◦ ) = 0. The number of edges ei containing each
of the three vertices in questions is found from (B.81).
#e ⊃ v1 = 5
#e ⊃ v4 = 5

(B.87)

h (D7 ) = 398 + 5 + 1 = 404

Only the last number depends on the triangulation chosen.
Let us now investigate the points νi interior to 1-faces ei . Here h2,0 (Di ) = 0 for
all cases. We start with v5 which is contained in e2 . We hence learn from (B.81) that
h1,0 (D5 ) = 0. For h1,1 , we have to evaluate

In the triangulation we are considering, there are three 1-simplices contained in f6
which each contribute 1 (as `∗ (f ◦ ) = 0) to h1,1 . For each 2-face apart form f6 , there
can only be a single 1-simplex containing ν5 , so that we conclude
h1,1 (D5 ) = 4 .

(B.90)

As described in general above, this means we should think of D5 as a fibration of a P1
over another P1 for which the fiber degenerates into a union of three P1 s over a single
point in the base.
The other two points ν2 and ν3 interior to edges are contained in the same edge,
e7 , so that
h1,0 (D2 ) = h1,0 (D2 ) = `∗ (e◦7 ) = 0 .
(B.91)
For the triangulation chosen, ν2 only connects to a single vertex inside f6 , whereas ν3
connects to two, hence
h1,1 (D2 ) = 2

h1,1 (D3 ) = 3 .

(B.92)

Finally, there is ν6 . As it is interior to a 2-face, it is n = `∗ (f6 ) + 1 = 1 copies of
a toric variety. This toric variety can be directly read off from the star fan to be the
Hirzebruch surface F1 for the triangulation chosen. Hence
h1,0 (D6 ) = h2,0 (D6 ) = 0

h1,1 (D6 ) = 2 .

(B.93)

A similar discussion can now easily be made for other triangulations. We can e.g.
consider a flop taking us from the triangulation on the upper left to the one on the
upper right. This will decrease the h1,1 of D3 and D6 by one, whereas the h1,1 of D5
and D4 are increased by one.

Hodge numbers hi,0 of toric divisors of Calabi-Yau n-folds

For Calabi-Yau manifolds of higher dimension than 3, the same technique as used above
can be used to find topological data of toric divisors restricted to a Calabi-Yau hypersurface. Whereas Hodge numbers such as h1,1 (Di ) will depend on the triangulation,
one can derive a remarkably simple formula for the Hodge numbers hi,0 . For a smooth

and a lattice point ν in the relative interior of a face Θ◦[n−d] of dimension n − d, the

where d > 2. Here Θ[d−1] is the face of ∆ dual to the face Θ◦[n−d] containing νD .
b = 1 holds for d > 2, as all such divisors are connected. Formula
Furthermore, h0,0 (D)
(B.94), which we will prove in the following, is the central result of this section. Note
that (B.94) reduces to the corresponding relations derived above for Calabi-Yau threefolds (where n = 4). In the threefold case, divisors associated with vertices (d = 4)
only have a non-vanishing h2,0 and divisors associated with points interior to edges
(d = 3) only have a non-vanishing h1,0 .
Let us assume that we are given a pair of reflexive polytopes ∆◦ , ∆ and a triangulation giving rise to a smooth projective toric variety10 PΣ . Let D be the toric divisor
associated with a lattice point νD contained in the relative interior of a face Θ◦[n−d] of

Any toric divisor D is composed of the strata associated with all cones that contain
the ray over νD . As before, these descend to a subset of the strata of Z and we can

sum their Hodge-Deligne numbers ep,q to find the Hodge numbers of D.
We first note that the cases d = 1 and d = 2 are trivial. In the first case, d = 1, D
does not give rise to any divisor on Z, while in the second case, d = 2, the face Θ◦[n−2]
is dual to a face of dimension n − (n − 2) − 1 = 1, denoted by Θ[1] , and it enjoys a
stratification of the form

We hence assume d > 2 in the following. Let us start by writing down the

As usual, (Θ◦[n−d+k] , Θ[d−1−k] ) are a pair of dual faces. For a divisor inside a face
Θ◦[n−d] , only strata on neighboring faces containing Θ◦[n−d] contribute. On ∆, this
can be expressed by saying that only faces Θ[d−1−k] of Θ[d−1] contribute. For each
such face, the toric strata (C∗ )l in each term originate from various simplices of the

triangulation on the faces Θ◦[n−d+k] dual to Θ[d−1−k] that contain the point νD . In
particular, a (C∗ )n−d+k originates from the point νD itself, a (C∗ )n−d+k−1 originates
from every 1-simplex in the interior of Θ◦[n−d+k] containing νD , and so on. Finally, the
highest-dimensional simplices, which are n − d + k-dimensional, give rise to points in
the above expression.
Our main tool in deriving (B.94) will be (B.35). Only the strata ZΘ[d−1−k] can
potentially contribute to hi,0 , as ei,0 ((C∗ )k ) = 0 for i > 0. Hence we will only need
to evaluate ei,0 (Θ[d−1−k] ) and e0,0 of the sum over simplices on the right-hand side of
(B.96).
b =0
The first conclusion that can be drawn directly from (B.35) is that hi,0 (D)
whenever i > d − 2. In this case, none of the strata ZΘ[d−1−k] can contribute, as we
would need to count points in faces of dimension i + 1 in the face ZΘ[d−1−k] , but even
for k = 0, there are no such faces. The geometric reason for this is that any divisor
associated with a point νD inside a face of dimension n − d should be thought of as an
exceptional divisor originating from the resolution discussed in §B.3. Correspondingly,
each such divisor is a fibration of a toric variety of dimension n − d (which degenerates
over various subloci) over an irreducible manifold of dimension d−2. Hence the highest
possible i for which hi,0 is nonzero is d − 2, as already established.
Indeed, we do get a nonzero contribution whenever i = d − 2. In this case, only
the stratum ZΘ[d−1] (i.e. k = 0) contributes and we find

The sum on the right hand side runs over all of the simplices on Θ◦[n−d] that contain νD ,
including νD itself, and the sign alternates according to the dimension of the simplex
in question as e0,0 ((C∗ )l ) = (−1)l .
If we neglect νD , the remaining simplices are arranged such that they form an
n − d − 1-dimensional polyhedron. It can be found by intersecting the various simplices
with an n − d − 1-sphere on Θ◦[n−d] centered at νD . Here, 1-simplices in the alternating
sum, which contribute (−1)n−d−1 above, correspond to vertices of the polyhedon. As

D

For every term in the above sum over k, we have to find the alternating sum of all
of the simplices containing νD on the face Θ◦[n−d+k] dual to Θ[d−1−k] to evaluate the
various e0,0 . For k = 0, we have already found that this sum simply gives 1 by relating
it to the Euler characteristic of a sphere. For higher values of k, we can essentially use
a similar argument. In this case, the point νD sits on the codimension-k hyperplane of
Rn−d+k defined by the face Θ◦[n−d] . Furthermore, the face Θ◦[n−d+k] will be bounded
by other hyperplanes of dimension greater than or equal to n − d, so that the set of all
simplices on Θ◦[n−d+k] connecting to νD will correspond to a triangulation of an open
subset of a sphere of dimension n − d + k − 1. This has Euler characteristic 1 in even
and −1 in odd dimensions. To fix the sign, note that points on this sphere correspond
again to 1-simplices, which in turn have a factor of (−1)n−d+k−1 in the sum. As such
points contribute 1 in the computation of the Euler characteristic, the contribution of
the sum over simplices to e0,0 is always equal to 1.
Using (B.35), we are hence led to

Note that each face containing νD appears multiple times and with alternating signs
in the above expression. In particular, a single face Θ[i+1] can appear multiple times
in a single term in the sum over k. Let us consider a single such face Θ[i+1] and find
how often it appears with which signs. First, note that we may equally well phrase
the problem in terms of faces of ∆◦ . Given the face Θ◦[n−d] containing νD and the face
Θ◦[n−i−2] dual to Θ[i+1] , the factor multiplying `∗ (Θ[i+1] ) for a fixed face of dimension
[i − 1] in the above sum is then simply
X
(−1)d−1−k .
(B.101)
k,Θ◦[n−d] ⊆Θ◦[n−d+k] ⊆Θ◦[n−i−2]

The contribution proportional to `∗ (Θ[i+1] ), the dual face of which is Θ◦[n−i−2] , is hence
given by counting all n − d + k-dimensional faces containing Θ◦[n−d] and contained in
Θ◦[n−i−2] . To compute this quantity, we again interpret this as an Euler characteristic
of a topological space as follows. Consider a sphere of dimension n−i−2−(n−d)−1 =
d−i−3 centered at νD and orthogonal to the face Θ◦[n−d] . All the faces contributing to
the sum above, except Θ◦[n−d] itself, will give rise to a decomposition of one closed half

59

of this sphere, which has Euler characteristic +1 in any dimension. The contribution
of the highest-dimensional stratum on this half-sphere has k = d − i − 2, so that it
contributes (−1)i−3 to the alternating sum in (B.101). As its dimension is d − i − 3,
it contributes (−1)d−i−3 to the Euler characteristic, so that the sum in (B.101), still
neglecting the face Θ◦[n−d] , is (−1)d . The face Θ◦[n−d] contributes (−1)d−1 , so that these
two terms always cancel and the sum (B.101) vanishes for any pair of faces Θ◦[n−d] and
Θ◦[n−i−2] . Hence the sum (B.100) vanishes except when d = i − 2, when only one term
in (B.101) contributes. This completes the proof of (B.94).

Computation of h2 for a Divisor on a 2-Face

In this appendix we give an alternative computation of h2 (OD ) in a special case (defined
below). We will compute h2 (OD ) directly in terms of a counting of lattice points in ∆,
arriving at a result that coincides with Theorem 3 in this subcase. This computation
provides an alternative perspective to that of the spectral sequence in §3.1.

h0 (OX (−D)) = 0 and so h3 (OX (D)) = 0.
Because V is a toric fourfold, we have the relation
h• (V, OV ) = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0) .

(C.3)

Using Serre duality (as in [27]) in the long exact sequence in cohomology induced by
the Koszul sequence
0 → OV (−X) → OV → OX → 0 ,
(C.4)
one immediately finds that the Hodge numbers h• (X, OX ) obey
h• (X, OX ) = (1, 0, 0, 1) .

(C.5)

Similarly, we can establish:
Proposition 24 For a space S, define h̃i (S) := hi (S) for i > 0, and h̃0 (S) := h0 (S) −
1. Then the following relations hold, for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3:

(C.10)

We consider the Koszul sequence for D ⊂ X, which reads
0 → OX (−D) → OX → OD → 0 .

(C.11)

Applying (C.5) and (C.2) to the long exact sequence in cohomology induced by (C.11)
yields (C.10). 
In particular, we have
Corollary 27
h2 (D, OD ) = h0 (X, OX (D)) − 1 .

We now examine the simplicial complex TD associated to D.

Because TD is by assumption contained in a single 2-face f , the last sum in (C.18) will only have
one term, but we find it useful to write (C.18) in a form that anticipates our result for a completely
general square-free divisor.

(C.25)

hm, ua i ≥ 0 .

(C.26)

The points m obeying (C.25) are by definition the lattice points in the face u◦j+1 of
∆, dual to the point uj+1 . We need to count points in u◦j+1 that also satisfy (C.24)
and (C.26). There are three types of ui : vertices, points interior to edges, and points
interior to f . We will include them in the set {ui } in that particular order. First
consider the case where uj+1 is a vertex of f . Then we need to solve
hm, uj+1 i = −1

(C.27)

hm, ua i ≥ 0 .

(C.28)

Equation (C.25) defines the facet u◦j+1 ∈ ∆(3). However, any point on the boundary
of u◦j+1 has a dual in ∆◦ , defined by hm , ·i = −1, that violates (C.28). The only points
that do not violate (C.28) are those in the interior of u◦j+1 , as they are dual only to
b 0 )) = 1 + g(uj+1 ).
uj+1 itself, and therefore h0 (V, OV (D
Next let uj+1 correspond to a point internal to an edge e ∈ ∆◦ (1). The condition
(C.28) is violated unless the entire edge, including the vertices bounding it, is included,
since hm, uj+1 i = −1 implies that hm, uα i = −1 for any uα ⊂ e. Therefore, a divisor
D corresponding to a complete edge e with vertices ua and ub has
b = 1 + g(vu ) + g(vu ) + g(e) .
h0 (V, OV (D))

(C.29)

In a similar manner we find that including points uα internal to f in the set {ui } can
only contribute to h2 if every point in the face f is included in {ui }. 
