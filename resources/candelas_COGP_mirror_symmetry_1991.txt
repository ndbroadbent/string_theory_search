We compute the prepotentials and the geometry of the moduli spaces for a Calabi-Yau
manifold and its mirror. In this way we obtain all the sigma model corrections to the Yukawa
couplings and moduli space metric for the original manifold. The moduli space is found to be
subject to the action of a modular group which, among other operations, exchanges large and
small values of the radius, though the action on the radius is not as simple as R ~ 1 / R . It is a - ~
shown that the quantum corrections to the coupling decompose into a sum over instanton
contributions and moreover that this sum converges. In particular there are no "'sub-instanton'"
corrections. This sum over instantons points to a deep connection between the modular group
and the rational curves of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The burden of the present work is that a
mirror pair of Calabi-Yau manifolds is an exactly soluble superconformai theory, at least as far
as the massless sector is concerned. Mirror pairs are also more general than exactly soluble
models that have hitherto been discussed since we solve the theory for all points of the moduli
space.

1. Introduction
The discovery of mirror symmetry [1-3] among pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds
goes a long way towards resolving a long standing puzzle. A Calabi-Yau manifold .,~/possesses a certain number of parameters. These are parameters associated with the structure of ¢~' as a complex manifold and parameters corresponding
to the deformations of the K/ihler metric of f / . These parameters, which are
related to the cohomology of/~', give rise to families and antifamilies of particles
in the effective low-ener~ theory that results from compactification of the string.
The parameters corresponding to deformations of the complex structure are
related to the cohomology group H 21 of (2, 1)-forms while the parameters corre* Supported in part by the Robert A. Welch Foundation and NSF grants PHY-880637 and PHY8605978.

sponding to deformations of the K~ihler form correspond to the group H ~j of
(1, 1)-forms. The Yukawa couplings of the low-energy theory correspond to certain
cubic forms on the cohomology ring [4]. There are no couplings between the two
different sorts of parameters, so the Yukawa couplings come in two types. The
puzzle has been that the two types of couplings are very different both at a
mathematical level and with regard to renormalization. The couplings corresponding to the complex structure parameters vary with the parameters and are not
renormalized either in loops or by instantons. By contrast the couplings corresponding to the K~ihler class are topological numbers that are integers in an
appropriate basis and which a r e renormalized by instantons [5-7]. In this sense
one might describe analysis based on a Calabi-Yau manifold as being "half exact".
However, since both .d" and its mirror 71/', for which the roles of the two types of
parameters are exchanged, correspond to the same superconformal theory, one
can combine the calculations and obtain exact results. One can compute both types
of Yukawa couplings by calculating the couplings for the complex structure
parameters of ¢/e' and then computing the remaining couplings, complete with their
sigma model corrections, by computing the couplings corresponding to the complex
structure parameters of 7r. The suggestion that Calabi-Yau manifolds should
arise in mirror pairs was made by Dixon and Gepner [8] and by Lerche et al. [9].
The latter paper also uncovered the chiral ring structure of the superconformal
theories. It is the identification of the chiral ring of the superconformal theory with
the cohomology ring of (2, 1)-forms [10] on the Calabi-Yau manifold that enables
us to perform exact calculations by means of geometrical methods.
Of course if the Yukawa couplings were all we could compute then the results
would not be very significant since we need also to be able to compute the metric
on the parameter space, which appears in the kinetic terms of the sigma model, in
order to correctly normalize the fields. Fortunately an extension of the nonrenorrealization theorem that ensures that the superpotential does not receive sigma
model corrections enables us to compute also the k:,r,~t,:c terms. The observation
that the existence of mirror manifolds permits the calculation of both types of
couplings has been made independently by Greene and Plesser [2], and also in the
interesting article by Aspinwall eta!. [3], who consider a mirror pair of manifolds
with A"= +40 that has several parameters and show that, in an appropriately
defined large complex structure limit, the Yukawa couplings for the complex
structure parameters of the mirror manifold coincide with the topological couplings of the original manifold. One of the new elements of the present work is
that we are able to solve, in the context of a particular example, for the Yukawa
couplings and the metric on the parameter space for all values of the complex
structure.
This article is devoted to a discussion of these issues in the context of the
solution of the conformal field theory of a particular example of a mirror pair of
Calabi-Yau manifolds. We take for the manifold f l the quintic threefold P4(5),

P. Candelas et al. / Calabi-Yau manifolds

23

which has b~ = l, b2m- 101 and Euler number - 2 0 0 . The mirror ~" of th~
manifold is known in virtue of a construction due to Greene and Plesser [2]. The
mirror ~ f has b~m = 101, b e ~ - 1 and Euler number + 200. What we do here is
calculate the prepotential for the complex structure parameter of ~ By mirror
symmetry this yields the fully corrected prepotential for the original manifold ~r.
Although we concentrate on a specific and simple case we befieve that many
features of our results are of general validity.
Since the present work is somewhat beset by detail we list here the salient results:
(i) The metric and the Yukawa couplings are computed complete with all sigma
model corrections for all points in the parameter space. There is a particular value
of the parameter for which the appropriate conformai field theory is the Gepner
model 3 5 and for this value we find agreement with the known coupling for this
model.
(ii) It is found that a modular group, F, acts on the parameter space. Among
other operations F exchanges large and small values of the radius. This is of
interest because it is relevant to the conjectured existence of a minimum fundamental length in string theory. The existence of a modular group has been noted
previously for the case of orbifolds [11], and some consequences of modular
invariance and the possibility that Calabi-Yau manifolds would also be subject to
a modular group has been examined in a number of papers [12]. The modular
group F however is not the group SL(2, 7/), as had previously been anticipated in
the literature, and the operation is not as simple as R - , 1/R.
(iii) The exact Yukawa coupling admits a decomposition into a sum over
instantons. The sum converges to the exact value so there are no "sub-instanton"
contributions to the coupling or prepotential. Moreover the decomposition of the
coupling into a sum over instanton contributions seems to indicate a deep connection between the automorphic functions of the modular group and the rational
curves (instantons) of .#/. As an illustration of this we seem to be able to read off
from our resu!ts the numbers of rational curves of each degree. This is quite likely
of mathematical interest.
(iv) We abstract from the particular pair of Calabi-Yau manifolds studied here
an expression for the fully corrected Yukawa coupling, which we conjecture to be
of general validity. The fundamental object from which the corrected coupling derives is not so much the "bare" manifold but rather a "quantum manifold" consisting of the bare manifold together with its rational curves. In physics-speak this
is just the statement that the quantum manifold is the bare manifold together with
all world-sheet instantens. However this statement is rendered more precise and
seems to be in line with recent developments in mathematics (for a review see [13]).
The layout of this paper is as follows: in sect. 2 we review the construction of the
mirror 7// and discuss the rudiments of the geometry of its space of complex
structures. A feature that is important for the three-dimensional case is the
existence of finite points in the parameter space corresponding to singular

24

Calabi-Yau manifolds. We describe here also the large complex structure limit
of .g/. The detailed structure of the metric and Yukawa couplings derive from a
discussion of the homology of ~ and a computation of the holomorphic three-form
from which the prepotential is constructed. This is done in sect. 3 and the metric
and couplings are derived from the prepotential in sect. 4. We turn in sect. 5 to
a comparison of the metric and couplings with the " b a r e " quantities appropriate
to / f . For the couplings we identify the quantum corrections with the contributions of instantons. For the metric, in addition to the exponentially small terms,
there is also a loop correction similar to the "four-loop term" found in another
context by Grisaru et al. [14]. We also extend the standard nonrenormalization
theorem to show that the four-loop term is the only loop term to affect the
prepotential. In sect. 6 we present a speculative proposal for a mechanism to
achieve a small breaking of supersymmetry at low energies. We have included this
proposal here even though it is logically separate from the issue of mirror
symmetry because the mechanism is based on a non-K~ihler resolution of a
conifold, and the conifold that arises in the study of the mirror manifold of P4(5) is
of precisely the type to which such a non-K~ihler resolution is appropriate. Finally
two appendices deal with a more detailed description of the homology of 7//" and
with further properties of the periods of the holomorphic three-form.

2. The mirror of P4(5)
Let M = P4(5) be the family of manifolds that can be represented as quintic
hypersurfaces in P4. There are 101 parameters associated with the complex
structure of these manifolds, which in this case can all be thought of as the
coefficients of the quintic polynomial (see e.g. ref. [10], and references to the
original literature cited therein). There is also one parameter associated with
the choice of K~ihler class which in this case can be thought of as the radius of the
P4. To construct the mirror manifold [2] we start with a one-parameter subfamily
M~ of quintic hypersurfaces given by the polynomials

These hypersurfaces are invariant under the symmetry group* generated by

g ~ - (0, 1 , 0 , 0 , 4 ) ,

where the ith entry is the power of the fifth root of unity multiplying the ith
coordinate. For example, gl represents the 7/5 action

( XI,X2,X3, X4,X5) .---->(Xl,OlX2,X3, X4,014Xs)
where a = e 2 ~ ' i / 5 . In virtue of the fact that the product of all the g's multiplies the
homogeneous coordinates by a common phase, only three of these are independent so we can choose to work with g~, g2 and g3, say. Note also that the quintic
polynomial (2.1) is in fact the most general quintic invariant under these identifications. A family W of mirror manifolds is then obtained by taking the quotient of
each Calabi-Yau manifold .~/~, in M~ by the group 2r3 generated by g~, g2 and g3The procedure for dividing out by the 7/5% involves cutting out the curves and
points of the manifold which are left invariant by the symmetries. After making the
2e3 identifications, the curves and points are replaced by their smooth equivalents.
The action of the 7/3 has the 10 fixed curves

Each of these curves is a P2(5) and is invariant under a Z 5 subgroup. These fixed

(there are in fact only ten of these points owing to the identifications (2.2)), each
being left invariant by a 7/5 × 7/5 subgroup. Each fixed curve contains 3 fixed
points, and 3 fixed curves meet in each of the fixed points. We will take care of the
curves and the points separately, so we need to know the Euler number of the
curves less the points. This is simply

x(P

25.

Also, we need to know how the 7/5% act on the curves. One leaves the curve
invariant and the other two identify it with itself. Thus we calculate the Euler
number of the mirror manifold to be

A curious fact is that the Euler number of P4(5) minus the fifty points and ten
curves is zero*.
* P.S. Aspinwall informs us that this is a general feature of constructing a mirror manifold by starting
with a manifold . ~ and dividing by a symmetry group. The noncompact manifcld that remains after
removing the fixed points and fixed curves has Euler number zero.

One naturally wonders if there are other ways of presenting this manifold. There
are in fact two ways of constructing the manifold as a hypersurface in weighted

and on reflection we see that the manifold is p4(41"48' 51' 52' 64)(256). Similarly, one can
also show* that the mirror manifold is also p4t51'6°'64"65"8°)(320) (thereby showing
that the two weighted hypersurfaces are biholomorphic). In this case the coordinate transformation takes the form

These weighted projective spaces appear in the tables of ref. [16] and have Euler
number +200 and bll = 101. We find it most convenient to work with the original
form (2.1) of the polynomial p, though we have to bear in mind that this form
refers to a covering space of 7/:. To get to 7/: itself we must make the identifications (2.2).
One of our aims is to describe the space of O's, that is the space W of complex
structures of ~',~. The first thing to note is that 0 and aO correspond to the same
complex structure since the replacement 0 ~ a 0 is equivalent to the coordinate
transformation
(XI , X 2 , X3,X4,X5)

"~ ( o l - l x 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 , X 5 )",

(2.3)

in other words, we learn that the true coordinate is 0 5.
To describe the geometry of W, it is important to note that there are special
values of 0 for which 7/:, is singular. This occurs when the quintic (2.1) fails to be

These points are all identified under the identifications (2.2) so that 7/" at ~ = 1
has only one singular point which we may as well take to be the point (1, 1, 1, 1, 1).
The singularity is a node, that is a point for which p and d p both vanish but the
matrix of second derivatives is nonsingular. For these values of ~,, the corresponding 7//" is a conifold [17]. This type of singular C a l a b i - Y a u manifold has been
described in some detail in refs. [17, 18]. For our present purpose it suffices to
recall that a neighborhood of the node is locally a cone with base s Z x S 3. For
values of ~ near ~b = 1, say, the situation is as in fig. 1. There is an S 3 which
shrinks to zero as ~b ~ 1.

given in fig. 2. We shall see later that 7f~ is the large complex structure limit of
7E~, and is the mirror of the large-radius limit of ~g/.
2.1. RUDIMENTS OF THE HOMOLOGY

The structure of the moduli space of a Calabi-Yau manifold reflects the
homology of the manifold. Recall that the complex structure of the manifold can
be described by giving the periods of the holomorphic three-form over a canonical
homology basis [17,19,20]. More precisely, we can proceed, for the case under
consideration for which bzt(Tf) = 1 and b 3 ( T f ) = 4 , as follows. We choose a
symplectic basis (AI,A2, BI, B2 ) for H3(~'//', 7/) such that
A" n B b = 6" b ,

A" n A b = 0,

B,, n B b = 0.

Let (ao, f i b ) be the cohomology basis dual to that above so that

f

A 'Ozb = r~ah ,

fB fl b = 8 " b ,

with other integrals vanishing. Then it follows that
f~,fll a A fib = t~ab '

Ola A Olb = 0"

Important in the following is the holomorphic three-form O. Being a three-form,
may be expanded in terms of the basis
O = zaa.

,~b)

The coefficients (z a,
are the periods of O, so called because they are given by
the integrals of O over the homology basis,

za=~2,

~b=fBg.

(2.7)

We have more periods than parameters. For the present case we have b 3 = 4
periods but we know there is only 1 ( = b2~) parameter for the complex structure.
We therefore choose to regard the ~'b as being functions of the z a, ~'b = ~'b(Z~)This leaves us with the z ~ as independent periods. We still have one parameter
too many but this turns out to fit in quite well. The scale of O is not defined. In
reality/2 is a section of a line bundle over the moduli space [21]. There is a gauge
invariance associated with D due to the fact that O is undefined up to multiplication by an arbitrary holomorphic function of the parameter

a(,)

(2.8)

and we can regard the two z a as projective coordinates for ,O. The , ~ and ~2 are
then homogeneous of degree one as functions of the z~,
o (

z ) =

a ( z ) ,

(

z ) =

(z ) ,

and it can be shown [17, 20] that the $'b are the gradients of a prepotential $'(z)
that is homogeneous of degree two,
0~

$'a = ~za

,

For the situation at hand for which the manifold can be represented by a single
polynomial, there is a well-known representation for the holomorphic three-form
[4, 10]. We make the specific gauge choice

(2.9)

30

P. Candelas et al. / Calabi-Yau manifolds

We shall have more to say about the gauge invariance in the following. For the
present however, (2.9) is a convenient choice because the replacement ~ -o aft, can
be undone by the coordinate transformation (2.3). Thus

=a(,).
As a choice of basis we take A z to be the S 3 that shrinks to zero as g, -o 1. The
cycle B z is then a three-cycle that intersects this S 3 in a point. The "tip" of B 2, the
rest of which lies outside the neighborhood, is indicated by the shading in fig. 1.
The other basis cycles _AI and B. do not intersect the S 3 and can be taken to lie
outside the neighborhood. We are concerned about the monodromy of the basis
about ~ = 1, say. Under transport about g, = 1, the S 3, being unambiguously
defined for each value of 6, will return to the same cycle. The cycle B 2 on the
other hand is really only defined as being the dual of the A 2, so nothing prevents
B z from aquiring a multiple of A 2. Thus
A2~

A2 ,

B 2 --~ B 2 +

for some integer n. The remaining cycles A I and B I are remote from the node and
so are unaffected by this process. The monodromy of the basis induces a monodromy for the periods (2.7),

We shall see later that the periods, as functions of 0, satisfy a linear differential
equation which has a singularity at g, = 1. The relation (2.10) can be understood to
describe the monodromy of the solutions of the differential equation about the
singular point. Such monodromy is familiar, expressing the fact that some of the
solutions of a differential equation in the neighborhood of a singularity contain
logarithms and hence are multivalued.

We have just argued that under transport around @ = 1 the period vector undergoes a transformation H - - . T H . The matrix T is symplectic, since the transformation must preserve the intersection numbers (2.6), and it is also integral, since the
homology basis is integral. We have observed also that @ and a~b correspond to
the same manifold. It follows that

n(a~,) =AH(~,),
with A an integral symplectic matrix such that A 5 = 1. We will obtain the precise
form of A in sect. 3 but for the present it suffices to remark that it is not the
identity, neither is T, since we will also find that the integer in (2.10) has the value
unity. The two matrices A and T generate a modular group F that acts on the
period vectors, and also on the universal covering space of W, which may be
identified with the upper half-plane in such a way that F acts by hyperbolic
isometrics. We shall denote the operations of replacing @ by a@ and of analytic
continuation about O = 1 by o~" and g . These operations are represented by the
matrices A and T. However, care is required when composing the operations since
the matrices compose "backwards". For example

g(~'n) = g ( A n )

=A(9-//) =ATII.

Transport about @ = a* corresponds to the operation ~e'k3-~'-k and hence to the
matrix
T, = .4 - k T A k ,

(2.12)

and the matrix T~ corresponding to transport about @ = o0 follows from the
observation that a sum of loops around the fifth roots of unity and around infinity
is contractible. Hence
T ~ ' = T4T3T2T, T = ( A T ) 5 .

(2.13)

Thus there are no new generators corresponding to these operations. ~,5 is a
modular invariant of F but we can pass to a modular parameter 3' = 3'(~b) such
that the action of F on 3' is represented by 2 × 2 matrices acting on the upper half
3'-plane. Since s¢ 5 = 1 we represent it as

A= _

cos ( 2 7 r j / 5 )

sin ( 2 7 r j / 5 ) I

- sin ( 2 7 r j / 5 )

cos ( 2 7 r j / 5 ) ] '

where the minus sign is of no consequence in virtue of the projectivity of the
representation, and j is an integer, 1 -<<j~< 4. Since j k is never the identity for
any k :# 0, 3- acts on the upper half-plane as a "deck transformation" of infinite
order. Some composition of 3- with powers of ~ may therefore be represented by

The magnitude of the translation is fixed by the fact that a fundamental region for
the normal subgroup of F generated by 3- is a ten-sided polygon whose sides are
permuted by ~ . This amounts to considering the images under ~v', o~/2, o~3 and
S~ 4 of the imaginary axis and then demanding compatibility with ~ . Fundamental
domains of F are illustrated in fig. 3.
The explicit form of 3'(qJ) may be found by seeking a map that maps the entire

aut,omorphic functions involving triangle functions [22]. If the fundamental region

maps 0 to a 0 and ~ transports ff about ~ = 1. It is straightforward to compute
the effect of these operations on y in virtue of (2.14) and the standard analytic
continuation formulae for the hypergeometric function*. If we require that the
action of A is to rotate fundamental regions by 2r r / 5 about the fixed point y = i,
then it turns out that j = 3 and we find

the fundamental regions of F are then as illustrated in fig. 4. In this representation
the action of ~¢ is simply that of multiplication by a.
We defer further discussion of F to sect. 5, save to observe that F which might
be termed the quantum modular group is not SL(2, Z), which had previously been
suggested as the modular group, based on its action on the "bare" moduli space of

P4(5).
In order to find the explicit form of the metric we need to evaluate explicitly the
periods of ~2. it is to this that we now turn.

3. The periods
We begin by specifying more carefully the A 2 and B 2 of our symplectic basis. A 2
is the S 3 that degenerates to zero at the conifold point qJ = 1 and B 2 is a certain
torus associated with the degeneration of the manifold as q / - , ~.
A 2= {xl, lx 5 = 1 ,
x ireal, i=1,2,3,

which is manifestly a n 5 3. The qualification in the definition of m2 concerning the
branch is necessary, owing to the fact that the surface p(x)= 0 for x~ real has
disconnected components, as is easily seen by observing that the line
(Xl,--Xl,O

, -1,1)

is remote from the point (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and yet identically satisfies p(x) = O.
On integrating the t h r e e - f o r m / 2 over A 2 we find

z2(¢') = fAf l
~.2

5 3 / 2 ( 4 ' - 1) + . . . .

(3.3)

The leading term may be obtained by integrating the zeroth-order locus (3.2), and
the higher terms may be calculated systematically by means of an iteration scheme.
Shortly we shall give an exact expression for z2(4') in terms of hypergeometric
functions.
For B 2 we take the cycle
B 2 = {xklx5 = 1, Ixil = I x 2 [ - I x 3 l - 3 ,
X4 given by the solution to p ( x ) = 0 that tends to zero as 4' ---, ~}.

(3.4)

To understand the condition on the branch of the solution, set x4 = (4'XIX2X3)I/4~
and write the equation p = 0 in the form

5

(1

5(4'x x2x3

+ --,

(3.5)

from which it is clear that to leading order as 4' --> 0% there is a solution for ~: given
by the first term on the right-hand side of eq. (3.5). Thus there is a branch for x 4
with x4 = O ( 4 ' - ! ) a s 4' ~ 0~ for fixed x I, x2, x3. On the other hand, by rearranging
the equation p = 0 into the form

s~4=5 -

( l + x t 5+ x ~ + x 3 5)
( 4'XlX2X3)5/4~

we see that there are four branches for x 4 that are O(4, !/4) as 4'--> oc for fixed
(x~,x2, x3). At this stage it is far from clear that, as defined, B 2 meets A 2 in a
single point. Showing that it does, requires a more detailed discussion of the

P. Candelas et at / Calabi-Yau manifolds

homology than we wish to give here, so we defer the demonstration of this fact to
appendix A. We turn instead to a computation of the periods.
We have

A comment regarding the orientations of the cycles A 2 and B 2 is necessary here.
The cycles do not possess an intrinsically defined orientation so a choice must be
made. We have already implicitly fixed the orientation of A 2 by eq. (3.3). This in
turn fixes the orientation of B 2 since we require that A 2 n B 2 = + 1. The choice
made in the second of eqs. (3.6) is consistent with this. As ~, --->~ we see that the
term involving ~, can be neglected and hence
~'2 ~ ( 2 " n ' i / 5 ) 3 ,

the factor of 5 -3 arising from the 7/3 identifications. For ~ large the integrand can
be expanded in powers of (~:4/~). sr can itself be computed as a power series in
0-~ in virtue of an iteration based on eq. (3.5). The result is of the form

useful to take advantage of this fact in order to write down a complete set of
periods. The restriction on arg 0 anticipates that analytic continuation of too(0)
will lead to branch cuts. The fact that periods of the type we are discussing satisfy
linear differential equations with regular singular points is a very general property
[23]. For the case at hand it is straightforward to check that

A standard maneuver for finding the other solutions to the differential equation

1 / 0 5 to 0 5 and to extracting a factor of 0 ~, with k = 1, 2, 3, or 4, from the

where the overbrace signifies that the parameter that is unity is to be omitted. This
basis is useful for some purposes, however we find it more convenient to base our
development on the functions m0(ak0). At first sight one might be tempted to
conclude from eq. (3.11) that m0(0) is a function of 0 5 but this is not the case
owing to the fact that there are branch cuts implicit in the definition of ~rt)(0). In

Fig. 5. The contour of integration for eq. (3.14) showing the poles of F ( - s ) and of F(5s + 1).

order to clarify this and to find explicit expressions for too(atO), we wish to
analytically continue m0(~) to a neighborhood of the origin. This is accomplished
by introducing an integral representation of Barne's type. If 0 < arg ~ < 2~-/5, we
have

1 fc
r ( - s ) r ( s s + 1) ei=~(5qs)_5,
~r°(~b) = 27ri- ds
F4(s + 1)

(3.14)

with the contour as in fig. 5. The integrand has poles on the positive real axis for
s = 0, 1, 2,... due to the presence of the factor F ( - s ) . If in addition Itbl > 1, the
contour can be closed to the right and (3.11) is recovered as a sum over residues. If
on the other hand I~bl < 1, the contour can be closed to the left enclosing the poles
of F(5s + 1). Thus we find

=

E F(m)F4(1-m/5)
,,,=,

I01 < 1.

(3.15)

We shall show presently that ~r0(~) contains logarithms when ~,5 = 1, so we
must specify cuts associated with these terms. It is convenient to take ~ro(~,) to be
analytic in the neighborhood of the origin, so we take the cuts to run radially
outward from the points qt = a k, k = 0 , . . . , 4 . It is clear from the form of the
differential operator that the functions
def

'i~j( {~t ) --" 1[~0( I~JlD " ),

j=O,...,4

(3.16)

all satisfy the differential equation. It is clear also from the series (3.15) that a.-'.y
four of these functions are linearly independent, the five nrs(~,) being subject to

P. Candelas et al. / Calabi-Yau manifolds

the single relation

E ~rj(~)=0.

(3.17)

j=0

We wish next to examine further the monodromy of this basis about the point
= 1. We have argued that the basis (if a, zb) transforms according to the rule
(2.10) under transport about the point ~ = 1. It follows that the ~rj have the
transformation rule

--if-

m j ( ~b) ~

--if--

~rj ( ~,") + c j z 2 ( ~b) ,

(3.18)

where the cj are a set of numerical coefficients. This transformation rule is
equivalent to the assertion that the ~rj have the structure
2rri)3
cj
--~
mj(d/) = 2.rr----fz2(d/)log(O - 1) + f j ( 0 ) ,

(3.19)

with Z2(I~/) and fj(O) analytic for I ~ - 11 < 1. The period Z2(~/) corresponds to
one of the indices which is unity in (3.10). The differential equation, as is easily
verified, admits two solutions that are given by power series about ~ = 1. These
are z2(~) and another series corresponding to the index 2. The other solutions
contain logarithms owing to the fact that the index 1 is repeated. One might have
anticipated a more complicated structure than (3.19), with the term multiplying the
logarithm being a more general linear combination of the two solutions that have
power series expansions. This however would not be consistent with (2.10).
Checking that the transformation rule is indeed as in (3.19) amounts to checking
the coefficient of (~ - 1)2 log(~b - 1) in wj(ff). This will be subsumed in the
following computation of the coefficients cj.
Suppose z2(O) has the expansion
47/-2

z2(~lJ)= 53•2 {(~b- I) + b(~b- 1)2 + ...}

(3.20)

about ~b = 1. Then from eq. (3.19) ~ve have

where the terms indicated by the ellipsis have finite limits as ~b ~ 1. Thus we can
calculate cj and b by differentiating the series (3.!5) and computing its leading

The next step is to express z2($) in terms of the basis mj($). The result is

(~rl(x + i e ) - ~ r l ( x - i e ) ) =

However

ml( x - ie ) = too( a( x - ie ) )

the last equality following from (3.8) which is valid for 0 ~< arg $ < 2~-/5. Thus eq.
(3.22) holds for ~b's just above the cut that extends from 1 to ~ (see fig. 6), and
hence by analytic continuation for all ~.
We now know z 2 and if2 in terms of the basis nrj, and we wish to find similar
expressions for z ~ and ff~. It turns out, rather surprisingly, that we do not have to
explicitly describe A 1 and B~ if we proceed somewhat indirectly. We choose a
specific basis of linearly independent ~rj and form a vector

by the coefficients ci, of the corresponding rows of m must vanish. Consider now

Given m we can return now to the monodromy of the bases about ~ -- 1,
w ~ t~r,

H ~

TH,

where the matrices t and T may be found from (3.18) and (3.25). Given the
transformations T and A, it is a simple matter to compute the monodromy of the
bases about the other singularities in virtue of eqs. (2.12) and (2.13). We record
these results in table 1. Referring to the table we see that the integer n in our
previous expression for the monodromy matrix (2.10) is in fact unity.

4. The prepotential, metric and Yukawa coupling
Given the periods (~a, Zb) it is now straightforward to construct the prepotential
and the metric. The prepotential can be defined by

Recall that the holomorphic three-form ~ has the variational property
092
f ~ ¢ ~ ^ o# = 0 ,
and that this property requires the ~'a to be the derivatives of the prepotential,
O~
~ = Oz ~ ,

a = 1,2.

As a consistency check we can verify that this relation is satisfied. To this end note
that, in virtue of the fact that the prepotential is homogeneous of degree two as a
function of the z ~,

~ ( z ' , z2) = ( z Z ) Z ~

(zl)

A short calculation now reveals that

P. Candelas et al. / Calabi-Yau manifolds

45

Thus for consistency the identity W[ z c, g'c] = 0 must be satisfied. We have checked
that it is indeed satisfied by the somewhat brutish method of expanding the
periods as power series in ~ by means of eqs. (3.15) and (3.25) and checking that
W[ z c, g'c] vanishes order by order. Actually, the vanishing of W[ z ~, g'~] is a very
natural condition as can be appreciated by noting that

f~a(¢) ^ a(~,')= zC(~,)~c(¢, ,) - z~(¢,)~(¢).

(4.1)

By differentiating this expression with respect to if' and setting i f ' = if, we find
that

W[z~,~'A = f a ^

and hence must vanish.

The metric on the moduli space follows from (4.2). A three-dimensional plot of
g , $ against ~k is presented in fig. 7. The cusp at ~, = 1 (there is of course only one
cusp owing to the identification ~, = a ~ ) corresponds to the value of ~b for which
7/" is a conifold. The metric is mildly singular at the conifold. It can be shown that
g , $ is asymptotically proportional to logl~b-11, so the conifold is at a finite
distance from the smooth manifolds in agreement with general results [17]. hi
order to compare the metric g~,$ with the corresponding metric for the moduli
space of P4(5), it is of interest to compute the asymptotic form of the metric as
~b -o o0. In appendix B series expansions, valid for I~1 > 1, are derived for the mj,

a loop correction to the metric which we shall discuss further in sect. 5. Note
finally that the singular manifold corresponding to 0 = ~ is infinitely distant from
the smooth manifolds.

4.1. THE YUKAWA COUPLING
In order to make contact with the Yukawa coupling we introduce a set of
"wronskians",

w~-~~ ~o-~o ~

Then, from eq. (4.1), we find a relation between the Yukawa coupling and W3,

(4.4)

=W 3 .

Now the form of W3 follows straightforwardly from the differential equation (3.9)
that governs the periods. Let us rewrite the equation in the form

Note now that

Wo= W, = w

The vanishing of W0 is trivial. W2 is the derivative of W~ and we have verified that
W~ vanishes. Note also the elementary identity

w,- 2w; +
Putting these results together we find

ref. [10].
Some comments are in order here concerning the gauge dependence of the
Yukawa couplings (for a full account in the spirit of the present work see refs.
[20,21]). It was noted previously that the holomorphic three-form is in reality
undefined up to multiplication by a holomorphic function of ~,

o--,fo,
and we refer to such a replacement as a gauge transformation. A gauge transformation induces a transformation of the period vector, 1I -~ f F l , and from eq. (4.4)
it follows that the coupling is gauge dependent,

KeO0 --')f 2 Keeo,
so is the K~ihler potential which transforms according to the rule
e-K ~ Ill 2 e - r .
The gauge choice is arbitrary and a physical quantity such as a decay rate cannot
depend on the gauge. It must therefore be the case that the coupling enters into
physical quantities only through the invariant combination
Yinvde=fg -3/2 e K I~1,

the factor of g-3/2 being included to remove the coordinate dependence of IKI
(since the effect of a gauge transformation on the K~ihler potential is K ~
K - log f - log f the metric is gauge invariant).

P. Candela.~ei aL / Calabi-Yau manifolds

Roughly speaking the mechanism that causes K to be replaced by the invariant
coupling is the following. The low-energy lagrangian contains terms of the form
g e -h',~DA" + ½gta&t 2 + ( xA'A'~b + conjugate).
With a suitable choice of covariant derivative D, this is invariant under

and 4) is invariant. We can normalize the kinetic terms by defining

~ = gl/2~b '

where/7 = arg K. Then the low-energy terms become
~D,f + ½1a~l-' + g - 3 / 2 e r IKI ( , ~ , ~ + conjugate).
We summarize the limiting forms of the metric, curvature and invariant Yukawa
couplings in table 2. The reader will recognize the value obtained for the invariant
coupling at ~ = 0 [7] as being the value corresponding to the G e p n e r model 35 [25].
This agreement is an important check on the mirror hypothesis. T h e ~ = ~ row of
table 2 gives the " b a r e " value of y~.~ as being 2/V~-. In ref. [7] this value is
incorrectly stated to be 1 / ~ - .
Finally we note that for a one-dimensional manifold that is special K~ihler, the
Ricci scalar is related to the invariant coupling by

A detailed comparison requires the explicit form of the mirror map t ~ ~b(t)

loop corrections, so we shall first discuss the loop corrections. Perhaps surprisingly
we shall see that there is a single loop correction to the bare prepotential.
5.1. THE LOOP T E R M

We have of course a nonrenormalization theorem [5], to the effect that there are
no sigma model loop corrections to the superpotential or equivalently, to the
couplings O39-/OwaOwbOw ¢. The prepotential is homogeneous of degree two, so it is
determined by its third derivative up to a quadratic term of the form
A ~ = ½wT.2"W ,

with .2" a symmetric constant matrix. We can decompose .2" into its real and
imaginary parts,
.2" = ~ + i,~,'.
The real and imaginary parts affect the prepotential differently. From eq. (5.3),
which may be written in the form
e - r = 2w*(Im l:)w,
with I: the matrix of second derivatives of 9-, we see that the real part of _2"
contributes neither to the Yukawa couplings nor to the metric of the moduli space.
Such a term is of no consequence and could be discarded. Alternatively, we can
absorb it into the bare part, 9-o, of the prepotential by extending the range of the
indices on the intersection numbers K,48c to include the value zero, so that

The imaginary part of .2" does affect the metric and since the contribution of y to
the prepotential,
def
.,"~--Ioop = i w ' • w ,

contains powers of the radius (recall that for the case of P4(5), t = w ~/W 2 and the
imaginary part of t is the square of the radius), it is precisely the loop correction
to . ~ .
We shall now argue that W]ooo contains a four-loop correction and that this is
the only loop correction to the prepotential*. In fact ~]oop is closely related to the

54

P Candelas et al. / Calabi-¥au man(folds

four-loop term found by Grisaru et al. [14] in their investigation of the/]-function
for type-(2,2) supers vmmetric it-models. The loop corrections arise because there
are loop corrections to the sigma model. When the heavy modes are integrated out
of the sigma model, part of the loop term survives into the low-energy theory.
When we refer to a four-loop term, we mean a four-loop contribution to the sigma
model. This corresponds to a third-order correction to the prepotential.
The particular case of P4(5) corresponds to b~a = 1 but it is simpler and more
general to leave b~ arbitrary for the present. The large-radius limit is the limit
w ° ~ 0 for fixed w "4 (this is the limit t ~ ~ for P4(5)) and the loop counting is that
1 / w ° corresponds to one loop and each additional power of w ° corresponds to an
additional loop. Thus the term iwT~/w contains, in principle, two-loop, three-loop
and four-loop terms. These terms must be constructed from local polynomials in
the curvature of ~v. These terms have to be universal, that is independent of any
structure, such as complex structure or the dimension of the space, that is
particular to ~#/. Furthermore, the loop contributions must vanish for hyper-Kiihler
manifolds. These conditions, which are clearly very restrictive, were investigated in
relation to the counterterms that can arise for the g-functions for type-(2,2)
supersymmetric tr-models [26]. It is known that there are no curvature polynomials
with the requisite properties that could correspond to two or three loops and that
there is a single such quantity at four loops,

where R#k ~ is the curvature tensor of .//. A further remarkable property of S for
Calabi-Yau manifolds in six dimensions is that S is proportional to the Euler
integrand. It can be shown that

Sgi/2 d6x = 12(2,n-)3c3,
where c 3 is the third Chern class.
Consider now the possible structure of the components ~ b - The component
Y0o can be of the form

fftoo=a f d 6 x g l / 2 s = 12(2,rr)3ax,
with a a numerical coefficient. The other components of y all vanish. The terms
YABWAW B and ~,'oAw°w A are respectively one- and two-loop terms for which, as
already mentioned, suitable curvature polynomials do not exist.
We therefore know the form of .~]oop up to a numerical coefficient independent
of .J~'. One way to fix the coefficient would be to actually evaluate a four-loop
graph. It is simpler however to compare with the corrected prepotential for [P4(5)

P. Candelas et ai. / Calabi-Yau manifdds

55

which we do in eq. (5.10) below. In this way we find that
i~'(3)
.~"l~p = 2(2~.)3 X.

(5.4}

For the case of P4(5) it is this contribution to the prepotential which produces
the subleading term in the metric in eq. (4.3) and is responsible for the fact that,
for large $, the Ricci scalar of the moduli space differs from its limiting value by
inverse powers of log $ as is evident from fig. 9.
5.2. T H E M I R R O R M A P

We find the relation between the coordinates $ and t by relating the period
vector H to the corresponding vector H for P4(5). The idea is that we expect the
prepotential ~' calculated in sect. 4 to be the fully corrected form of the bare
prepotential .9-o given by (5.2). The complication is that the form of the prepotential depends on the choice of symplectic basis. So we must first find the relation
between the symplectic bases for ~ and M'. We do this by relating H and H for
large radius and large complex structure.
The leading behaviour of H is derived from the leading behaviour of the
prepotential ~-, which we take to be

that they may be related by an integral symplectic matrix is the observation already

This equation gives the mirror map. We have introduced the coordinate t partly to
make contact with previous work but primarily because 2krcit is the value of the

the coefficient in eq. (5.4). Lastly there are exponentially small terms which may be
thought of as instanton corrections.

We wish to examine these exponentially small terms. The idea is to examine the
difference between ff and ~-0- However, as mentioned above, one must also allow
for the effect of the symplectic transformation N. It is simpler to consider first the
instanton contribution to the Yukawa coupling, which is of interest in its own right,
the corresponding contributions to ~ can then be obtained by integration. We
have

(5.12)

To understand the structure of this sum consider the contribution of a rational
curve ~ of degree k to the coupling. A rational curve of degree k is a P~
embedded by equations of degree k. Equivalently it is characterized by the fact
that

where e is the generator of H 2(P4(5), 7/). The contribution of _~ to the coupling is

[7]

exp(2rritfzf)(fsf

= k 3 e 2~rikt

It is necessary to consider also multiple covers of the rational curves. For example,
at degree 2 there are embeddings P~ ~ P4(5) given by

(i): (u, U) + (//2, U 2,//U, 0, 0),
(ii): ( u , v ) ~ ( u 2 , v2,0,O,O).
These are given as embeddings P~ ~ P4, but for suitable quintics the curves lie in
the quintic hypersurface. The image in case (i) is a rational curve of degree 2 while

59

P. Candelas et al. / Calabi-Yau manifolds

case (ii) is a double cover of the line ( u , v , O , O , O ) which is a rational curve of
degree 1. Note that the two cases are intrinsically different, we cannot by means of
a coordinate transformation transform case (ii) to case (i). More generally, an
m-fold multiple cover of a rational curve of degree k is an embedding Pt ~ P4(5)
such that the homogeneous coordinates of the P4 are polynomials of degree k in
quantities (U, V) that are themselves polynomials of degree m in the homogeneous
coordinates of the P~. One difference between the multiple covers and the single
covers is that it appears that the single covers have no parameters (it is proved in
ref. [28] that the single covers have no parameters for k < 7) while m-fold covers
with m > 1 do have parameters. Since the quantities U and I / a r e polynomials of
degree m in the coordinates (u, v) of the Pl they each contain m + 1 parameters.
Taking into account the three degrees of freedom in a reparametrization
( u, v ) -o ( au + b y , cu + d r ) ,

a d - bc = 1,

of the P l and the freedom to multiply U and I / b y a common scale, we find
2 ( m + 1) - 3 -

parameters.
We shall assume that an m-fold cover contributes an amount k 3 e 2~im~' to the
coupling. Since

•

j=mk,

l

this amounts to the assumption that m-fold covers have an associated prefactor
1 / m 3 (otherwise the contribution would be ( i n k ) 3 e2rrimkt). We believe that this
prefactor derives from the zero modes associated with the parameters that the
m-fold covers enjoy, but we have not performed the computation. The reason for
assuming this specific form for the prefactor will become apparent as we proceed.
With this understanding we find that the contribution to the coupling of a rational
curve S a of degree k together with all its multiple covers is

number of conics [28] (rational curves of degree two). Clemens has shown [30] that
n~ ~: 0 for infinitely many k and has conjectured that n k ~: 0 for all k, but it seems
that the direct calculation of these numbers becomes difficult beyond k = 2 (see
also ref. [28]). It is however straightforward to develop the series (5.12) to more
terms and to find the n~ by comparison with (5.13). We present the first few n k in
table 4. These numbers provide compelling evidence that our assumption about
the form of the prefactor is in fact correct. The evidence is not so much that we
obtain in this way the correct values for n~ and n 2, but rather that the coefficients
in eq. (5.12) have remarkable divisibility properties. For example asserting that the
second coefficient 4,876,875 is of the form 23n2 + n I requires that the result of
subtracting n~ from the coefficient yields an integer that is divisible by 2 3.
Similarly, the result of subtracting n~ from the third coefficient must yield an
integer divisible by 3 3. These conditions become increasingly intricate for large k.
It is therefore remarkable that the n k calculated in this way turn out to be
integers.
The values for the nk shown in the table are particular to P4(5), however we can
abstract from eq. (5.13) a form for the mirror map which we conjecture to be of
general validity,

Eq. (5.14) embodies the moral of the present work. There is a "bare manifold" .ng
and a "quantum manifold" 7// and the quantum manifold is the bare manifold
together with its rational curves.

It is immediately apparent from table 4 that the nk grow very rapidly with k. It
is of interest to observe that the distribution of the n k for large k is governed by
the conifold at ~ = 1. Consider again the series (5.12) which gives the Yukawa
coupling as a power series in e 2tit. The radius of convergence of the series is
determined by the singularity of the Yukawa coupling and the coupling is singular
only when q~5 = 1, so we conclude that the series (5.12) converges for
lm t > Im t ( 1 ) .
From this it follows that n , cannot grow faster than e - 2 ~ i k t t l ~ for large k.
However, we can do better and find the asymptotic form of nk from the singularity
of the coupling.
First we need to know the behaviour of t ( ~ ) as ~b ~ 1. From eq. (5.9) we find

t(~) -t(1) ~

subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion fall off as inverse powers of log k. To
speed the convergence we apply a variant of a Richardson transformation [31] to
the series, the aim being to eliminate the effect of the subleading terms. We set

5.5. SOME F U R T H E R REMARKS ON T H E MODULAR G R O U P

We saw previously that the modular group F acts most simply on a modular
parameter y. A puzzling fact is that 3' does not appear to be the quantity that is of
most direct physical interest. For example, the coordinate that arises naturally in
the instanton sum is the coordinate t which is related to the complex K~ihler form
by the relation B + / J = te. The coordinate t is, as we have seen, proportional to
the value of the instanton action and has a direct significance since Im t = R 2,
where R, in this context, is the radius of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The puzzle is
that t and y do not appear to be related in a simple way, though of course both
are functions of tO. It is perhaps worth recalling here the relations

6. A mechanism for supe~ymmetry breaking
The purpose of this section is to present a speculative mechanism which breaks
super~mmetB, for the low-chert, theoB,. The proposal is logically independent of
the mirror symmetB~ that is the focus of the present article; however we include it
here ~ c a u s e it arises naturally as part of the discussion of the conifold at ~ = 1.
In refs. [17, 18] it has been observed that the nodes of a conifold can be resolved
in different ways. One is by s m ~ t h i n g whereby the node is replaced by an S ~ as in
fig. 1. Another way is to replace the node by an S 2 as indicated by fig. 13.
The construction that achieves this is entirely local in nature. However, in
replacing the node by an S ~" we interfere with the cohomolo~' group H-" and it

then the resulting manifold ~ ' is a Moishezon manifold but it is not ~ e r .
case at hand is of just this type and this follows from the fact that the conifold has
just one node. Let W be the resolving S-" = P~ then the essential point is that ~ is
a boundary (we are indebted to T. Hfibsch for explaining this ~ i n t to ~ ) . We
see this by considering the sequence of operations depicted in fig. 13. In passing
from . ~ to .~r a puncture is made in B 2 and the punctur= is b|~vn up into W. T h ~
B 2 now has a boundary 8 B 2 = ~ . L e t a l s o J = ig~,~ d x ~' A d x ~ ~ t ~ putative

The first integral is the area of W which is strictly positive. Thus d J cannot vanish
identically and hence .4# cannot be Kiihler.
It was observed in reL [32] that such a compactification of string theory has
certain attractive features. The holonomy group of M~" is presumably ~ 6 ) so
embedding the spin connection in the gauge group breaks E s x E s to E s x O(I0)
and we can have broken supersymmetry while retaining vanishing c o s m o | o g i ~
constant. This proposal is cast in the geometrical language of Kaluza-[]ein theory.
because it is geometrical in nature and we do not yet know how to formulate these
ideas in terms of conformal field theory. It does however show a way of resolving
what was regarded as a difficult problem in the days of Kaluza-Klein theory which
was how to introduce a length scale, different from the compactification scale,
which could correspond to low-energy supersymmetry breaking. Here we have a
second length scale arising as the radius of the resolving P t. In some appropriate
sense supersymmetry is only slightly broken if this parameter is small, though we
have no argument as to why the scale of the resolving Pt should be vastly different
from the compactification scale.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge instructive discussions with Paul AspinwalI, WiIIy
Fischler, Brian Greene, Vadim Kaplunovsky. Sheldon Katz, Andy LBtkem
Fernando Quevedo, Graham Ross and Andy Strominger. We are indebted also to
Vadim Kaplunovsky and Karen Uhlenbeck for making computer resources available.

Appendix A
A S E C O N D L O O K AT T H E H O M O L O G Y O F ~

The function of this appendix is to make a more detailed study of the homolo~¢
of 7/p and to close the gap left in sect. 3 by showing that the cycles A 2 and B z do

66

P. Cat,debts et aL / C,~labi-Y~m mal~ifohls

indeed intersect in a point. We also make some further observations concerning
the monodromy of the cycles and find cycles Q / c o r r e s p o n d i n g to the periods nrj.
We begin by defining three-chains Vj, j - - 0 . . . . ,4,
Vi(tO) = { x k l x 5 -- 1, x i , x 2 , x 3 real and positive, the branch of
x 4 chosen such that arg x 4 ~ ~" + 2 7 r j / 5 as ~ ~ 0}.
The five Vj are chains rather than cycles, however a little thought shows that in
virtue of the identities (2.2) they have a common boundary, that is aVj is
independent of j. So the difference of any two Vj is a cycle. We find x4 by solving
the quintic which we write in the form

A = 1 +x~+x 2+x~.

5 t o x ~ x ,,.x ~.x 4 + A = 0 ,

Setting also
XIX2X 3

x 4 = gt/srl,

t~ =

A4/5

,

we have
r/5 - 5tOur/+ 1 = 0.

(A.1)

This equation has of course five roots for given ( x ~ , x 2 , x 3 ) . For tO sufficiently
small these can be found by rewriting (A.1) in the form
r//= -ozJ(1 - 5tOur/j) i/5 ,

(A.2)

and iterating the equation. It is easy to show that u is bounded, in fact, u varies in
the range
0 <~ U <~ 4 - 4 / 5 ,

(A.3)

so for to sufficiently small the root r/i is unambiguously defined by the iteration. It
is clear that for small tO the Vj have no points in common apart from their
boundaries.
We wish next to enquire how the Vj vary with to. In order to accomplish this we
first consider the behaviour of the roots of eq. (A.1). It is evident that (A.1) cannot
have a purely imaginary solution for r/ if tO is real since then the first two terms
would be purely imaginary and the third term real. Next we observe that (A.1) has

P. Candelas et aL / Calabi-Yau manijfolds

67

a double root if in addition 1/satisfies the equation
1/4 __ ~///.

It follows that (A.1) has a double root if and only if
( ~ u ) 5 = 4 -4 ,

(A.4)

1/5 = I

(A.5)

and that a double root satisfies

One immediately sees that (A.1) cannot have a triple root or two double roots for
any value of 4'. As a consequence of (A.3) and (A.4) 7/will have a double root for
some value of (xj,x2, x 3) if and only if ~5 is real and 14,1 1> 1. It follows that we
can unambiguously extend the definition of the Vj to the dJ-plane cut as in fig. 3.
Consider now the behaviour of the roots as ~, runs from 0 to ~ through real values.
For ~ = 0 the five roots are, as we have already seen, 1/j = - a j. Since there are no
purely imaginary roots for any real ~, it follows that three of the roots have
negative real part and two have positive real part. Moreover, since there cannot be
a double root that is real and negative, in virtue of (A.5), the three roots with
negative real part will always consist of a real root and a conjugate pair of complex
roots.
On the other hand the two roots with positive real part will consist of a
conjugate pair for
4-4/5
U

and will be distinct and real for
4-4/5

~>~,

with a double root precisely when

The situation for large ~ was discussed in sect. 3. One of the roots approaches 0,
while the other four recede to infinity along trajectories that are asymptotic to the
four semi-axes. The two roots with positive real part therefore approach 0 and ~:,
respectively, while the three roots with negative real part all become infinite. A

rt3 become real and move as shown if tO has an infinitesimal positive imaginary part.

plot of the trajectories is presented in fig. A.1. These considerations will shortly
allow us to compute A 2 tq B 2.
We now look at the chains Vj()) for tO > 1 which we define as the limit of Vj(to)
with Im to positive. It follows from the foregoing that V o, V~, V4 and V 2 t) V 3 are
disjoint and that V 2 intersects V 3. Let X be the subset of V 2 u V 3 for which
4-4/5

(A.6)

to

X consists of two three-chains, corresponding to the two positive solutions of (A. 1)
that have positive real part, with their boundaries identified because there is a
double root precisely when equality holds in (A.6). A little reflection should
convince the reader that the two three-chains are topologically three-balls and that
the boundaries of these three-balls are identified with opposite orientation so that
X is an S 3. In fact X is the cycle A 2 of sect. 3.
We are now in a position to compute A 2 c3 B 2. The definition (3.1) of A z
restricts all coordinates to be real and positive. The definition (3.4) of B 2 requires
that Ix il = Ix zl = Ix31 = 6, s o in fact
X 1 " - X 2 : X 3 - - ¢~.

Because ,~ in the definition of B e is chosen to exclude multiple values of x 4 and in
fact forces strict inequality in (A.6), there are exactly two points which satisfy all
these restrictions, corresponding to the two positive real roots for r/. However, as
we have already seen, exactly one of these is on the branch for which x4 ~ 0 as
to ~ ~. Consequently, the intersection of A 2 and B 2 consists of a single point.

Fig. A.2. Two choices for the cycle ~,~.One composed of straight lines, the other smooth.

The last point we shall address in this part of the discussion is the monodromy
of the cycles
def

% =

with respect to a loop circling the point ~, = 1. From the discussion above, it
follows that as we go around such a loop, the chains V~ remain unchanged except
for j - 2, 3, and that the chains V 2 and V3 exchange the balls corresponding to eq.
(A.6). This can be expressed as adding X to V 2 and substracting X from V 3 (there
is an orientation of X implicit in this choice). The monodromy of the cycles can
now be readily computed. We leave this as an exercise for the diligent reader.
CYCLES CORRESPONDING TO THE PERIODS ~j

As a final topic in this appendix we wish to find cycles Qj corresponding to the
periods ~rj. The Qj together with the relation (3.23) serve to define the cycles A ~
and B~, which have hitherto been defined only implicitly. Of course we know that
the period corresponding to BE(~) is proportional to ~r0(~,), so cycles corresponding to the ~rj are proportional to BE(~J~), with the continuation performed along
paths that go from ~, to aJ~ without crossing the cuts. We shall here give an
alternative definition of the Qj and relate these cycles to the Vj discussed above.
Let Yi, i = 1, 2, 3, be the one-cycles consisting of the union of the two half-lines
arg xi -- 2 ~ ' / 5 and arg x~ = 0. The reason for choosing the cycle as we have is that
u is bounded on the cycle. For other cycles, such as taking the x i to be real, this is
no longer true so that the term ~u in eq. (A.2) is not necessarily small for small #.
We define the cycle Qk by taking (Xi, XE, X3) E Yl X ~/2 X •3 and x4 to be given by
the (k + 3)rd branch of the quintic.
Solving eq. (A.2) by iteration we find
~(kO) = --O~k ,

-d'(z +

throughout the fundamental region. It is simplest to begin by discussing the basis

and the factor 1/F(5s + k)
renders the integrand finite. There are however fourth-order poles when
s = -N-k/5.
These are not of fifth order, again because of the F(5s + k) in the
denominator. Extracting the residues involves the expansion of ~b5s about
s = - N - k / 5 . This produces the log ~b, log 2 ~b and log 3 ~b terms. The ~ry are given
