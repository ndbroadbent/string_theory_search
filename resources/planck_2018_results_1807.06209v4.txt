ABSTRACT

We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results,
improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on
many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5 σ level. We find good consistency with the standard
spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base ΛCDM” in this paper),
from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Ωc h2 = 0.120 ± 0.001,
baryon density Ωb h2 = 0.0224 ± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 ± 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 ± 0.007 (in this abstract we quote
68 % confidence regions on measured parameters and 95 % on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03 % precision, with
100θ∗ = 1.0411 ± 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors,
in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are:
Hubble constant H0 = (67.4±0.5) km s−1 Mpc−1 ; matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315±0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811±0.006.
We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ΛCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and
considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom
P to be Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17, in agreement with
the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to mν < 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue
to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ΛCDM at over 2 σ, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away
from the ΛCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry)
BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, ΩK = 0.001±0.002. Also combining
with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = −1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological
constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and
Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 < 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and
deuterium abundances for the base-ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ΛCDM results are in good
agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey’s combined-probe results
including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6 σ, tension with local
measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not
favoured by the Planck data.

Since their discovery (Smoot et al. 1992), temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have become
one of the most powerful ways of studying cosmology and the
physics of the early Universe. This paper reports the final results
on cosmological parameters from the Planck Collaboration.1
Our first results were presented in Planck Collaboration XVI
(2014, hereafter PCP13). These were based on temperature
(T T ) power spectra and CMB lensing measurements from the
first 15.5 months of Planck data combined with the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) polarization likelihood
at multipoles ` ≤ 23 (Bennett et al. 2013) to constrain the reionization optical depth τ. Planck Collaboration XIII (2016, hereafter PCP15) reported results from the full Planck mission (29
months of observations with the High Frequency Instrument,
HFI), with substantial improvements in the characterization of
the Planck beams and absolute calibration (resolving a difference between the absolute calibrations of WMAP and Planck).
The focus of PCP15, as in PCP13, was on temperature observations, though we reported preliminary results on the highmultipole T E and EE polarization spectra. In addition, we
used polarization measurements at low multipoles from the Low
Frequency Instrument (LFI) to constrain the value of τ.
Following the completion of PCP15, a concerted effort by
the Planck team was made to reduce systematics in the HFI polarization data at low multipoles. First results were presented
in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016), which showed evidence for a lower value of the reionization optical depth than
in the 2015 results. Further improvements to the HFI polarization maps prepared for the 2018 data release are described in
Planck Collaboration III (2020). In this paper, we constrain τ
using a new low-multipole likelihood constructed from these
maps. The improvements in HFI data processing since PCP15
have very little effect on the T T , T E, and EE spectra at high
multipoles. However, this paper includes characterizations of
the temperature-to-polarization leakage and relative calibrations
of the polarization spectra enabling us to produce a combined
TT,TE,EE likelihood that is of sufficient fidelity to be used to test
cosmological models (although with some limitations, which
will be described in detail in the main body of this paper). The
focus of this paper, therefore, is to present updated cosmological
results from Planck power spectra and CMB lensing measurements using temperature and polarization.
PCP13 showed that the Planck data were remarkably consistent with a spatially-flat ΛCDM cosmology with purely adiabatic, Gaussian initial fluctuations, as predicted in simple inflationary models. We refer to this model, which can be specified by six parameters, as “base” ΛCDM in this paper. Note
that in the base ΛCDM cosmology we assume a single minimalmass neutrino eigenstate. We investigated a grid of one- and
two-parameter extensions to the base-ΛCDM cosmology (varying, for example, the sum of neutrino masses, effective number
of relativistic degrees of freedom Neff , spatial curvature ΩK , or
dark-energy equation of state w0 ), finding no statistically significant preference for any departure from the base model. These

conclusions were reinforced using the full Planck mission data
in PCP15.
The analyses reported in PCP13 and PCP15 revealed some
discrepancies (often referred to as “tensions”) with non-Planck
data in the context of ΛCDM models (e.g., distance-ladder measurements of the Hubble constant and determinations of the
present-day amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum), including
other CMB experiments (Story et al. 2013). As a result, it is
important to test the fidelity of the Planck data as thoroughly
as possible. First, we would like to emphasize that where it
has been possible to compare data between different experiments at the map level (therefore eliminating cosmic variance), they have been found to be consistent within the levels set by instrument noise, apart from overall differences in
absolute calibration; comparisons between WMAP and Planck
are described by Huang et al. (2018), between the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck by Louis et al. (2014),
and between the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck by
Hou et al. (2018). There have also been claims of internal inconsistencies in the Planck T T power spectrum between frequencies (Spergel et al. 2015) and between the ΛCDM parameters obtained from low and high multipoles (Addison et al.
2016). In addition, the Planck T T spectrum preferred more
lensing than expected in the base-ΛCDM model (quantified
by the phenomenological AL parameter defined in Sect. 2.3)
at moderate statistical significance, raising the question of
whether there are unaccounted for systematic effects lurking
within the Planck data. These issues were largely addressed in
Planck Collaboration XI (2016), PCP15, and in an associated
paper, Planck Collaboration Int. LI (2017). We revisit these issues in this paper at the cosmological parameter level, using
consistency with the Planck polarization spectra as an additional check. Since 2013, we have improved the absolute calibration (fixing the amplitudes of the power spectra), added
Planck polarization, full-mission Planck lensing , and produced
a new low-multipole polarization likelihood from the Planck
HFI. Nevertheless, the key parameters of the base-ΛCDM model
reported in this paper, agree to better than 1 σ2013 2 with those determined from the nominal mission temperature data in PCP13,
with the exception of τ (which is lower in the 2018 analysis by
1.1 σ2013 ). The cosmological parameters from Planck have remained remarkably stable since the first data release in 2013.
The results from Planck are in very good agreement with simple single-field models of inflation
(Planck Collaboration XXII 2014; Planck Collaboration XX
2016). We have found no evidence for primordial
non-Gaussianity
(Planck Collaboration XXIV
2014;
Planck Collaboration XVII 2016), setting stringent upper limits. Nor have we found any evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects (see PCP15 and
Planck Collaboration XX 2016). Planck, together with
Bicep/Keck (BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck Collaborations
2015) polarization measurements, set tight limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves generated during inflation. These
results are updated in this paper and in the companion papers,
describing more comprehensive tests of inflationary models
(Planck Collaboration X 2020) and primordial non-Gaussianity
(Planck Collaboration IX 2020). The Planck results require
adiabatic, Gaussian initial scalar fluctuations, with a red-tilted
spectrum. The upper limits on gravitational waves then require
flat inflationary potentials, which has stimulated new devel2

opments in inflationary model building (see e.g., Ferrara et al.
2013; Kallosh et al. 2013; Galante et al. 2015; Akrami et al.
2018, and references therein). Some authors (Ijjas et al. 2013;
Ijjas & Steinhardt 2016) have come to a very different conclusion, namely that the Planck/Bicep/Keck results require
special initial conditions and therefore disfavour inflation. This
controversy lies firmly in the theoretical domain (see e.g.,
Guth et al. 2014; Linde 2018), since observations of the CMB
constrain only a limited number of e-folds during inflation, not
the initial conditions. Post Planck, inflation remains a viable
and attractive mechanism for accounting for the structure that
we see in the Universe.
The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes changes to our theoretical modelling since PCP15
and summarizes the likelihoods used in this paper. More
comprehensive descriptions of the power-spectrum likelihoods
are given in Planck Collaboration V (2020), while the 2018
Planck CMB lensing likelihood is described in detail in
Planck Collaboration VIII (2020). Section 3 discusses the parameters of the base-ΛCDM model, comparing parameters derived from the Planck T T , T E, and EE power spectra. Our best
estimates of the base-ΛCDM cosmological parameters are derived from the full Planck TT,TE,EE likelihood combined with
Planck CMB lensing and an HFI-based low-multipole polarization likelihood to constrain τ. We compare the Planck T E and
EE spectra with power spectra measured from recent groundbased experiments in Sect. 4.
The Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology is compared with external data sets in Sect. 5. CMB power spectrum measurements
suffer from a “geometric degeneracy” (see Efstathiou & Bond
1999) which limits their ability to constrain certain extensions to
the base cosmology (for example, allowing ΩK or w0 to vary).
Planck lensing measurements partially break the geometric degeneracy, but it is broken very effectively with the addition of
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from galaxy
surveys. As in PCP13 and PCP15 we use BAO measurements as
the primary external data set to combine with Planck. We adopt
this approach for two reasons. Firstly, BAO-scale determinations
are relatively simple geometric measurements, with little scope
for bias from systematic errors. Secondly, the primary purpose
of this paper is to present and emphasize the Planck results. We
therefore make minimal use of external data sets in reporting
our main results, rather than combining with many different data
sets. Exploration of multiple data sets can be done by others using the Monte Carlo Markov chains and Planck likelihoods released through the Planck Legacy Archive (PLA).3 Nevertheless,
Sect. 5 presents a comprehensive survey of the consistency of
the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology with different types of astrophysical data, including Type 1a supernovae, redshift-space distortions, galaxy shear surveys, and galaxy cluster counts. These
data sets are consistent with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology with, at worst, moderate tensions at about the 2.5 σ level.
Distance-ladder measurements of the Hubble constant, H0 , are
an exception, however. The latest measurement from Riess et al.
(2019) is discrepant with the Planck base-ΛCDM value for H0
at about the 4.4 σ level. This large discrepancy, and its possible
implications for cosmology, is discussed in Sect. 5.4.
Section 6 investigates the internal consistency of the Planck
base-ΛCDM parameters, presenting additional tests using the
T E and EE spectra, as well as a discussion of systematic uncertainties. Results from our main grid of parameter constraints

ogy are presented in Sect. 7. That section also includes discussions of more complex models of dark energy and modified gravity (updating the results presented in Planck Collaboration XIV
2016), primordial nucleosynthesis, reionization, recombination,
and dark matter annihilation. Section 8 summarizes our main
conclusions.

2. Methodology and likelihoods
2.1. Theoretical model

The definitions, methodology, and notation used in this paper
largely follow those adopted in the earlier Planck Collaboration
papers dealing with cosmological parameters (PCP13, PCP15).
Our baseline assumption is the ΛCDM model with purely adiabatic scalar primordial perturbations with a power-law spectrum.
We assume three neutrinos species, approximated as two massless states and a single massive neutrino of mass mν = 0.06 eV.
We put flat priors on the baryon density ωb ≡ Ωb h2 , cold dark
matter density ωc ≡ Ωc h2 , an approximation to the observed angular size of the sound horizon at recombination θMC , the reionization optical depth τ, the initial super-horizon amplitude of
curvature perturbations As at k = 0.05 Mpc−1 , and the primordial spectral index ns . Other parameter definitions, prior limits,
and notation are described explicitly in table 1 of PCP13; the
only change is that we now take the amplitude prior to be flat in
log As over the range 1.61 < log(1010 As ) < 3.91 (which makes
no difference to Planck results, but is consistent with the range
used for some external data analyses).
Changes in our physical modelling compared with PCP15
are as follows.
– For modelling the small-scale nonlinear matter power spectrum, and calculating the effects of CMB lensing, we use the
halofit technique (Smith et al. 2003) as before, but now replace the Takahashi et al. (2012) approach with HMcode, the
fitting method of Mead et al. (2015, 2016), as implemented
in camb (Lewis et al. 2000).
– For each model in which the fraction of baryonic mass in
helium YP is not varied independently of other parameters,
the value is now set using an updated big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) prediction by interpolation on a grid of values calculated using version 1.1 of the PArthENoPE BBN
code (Pisanti et al. 2008, version 2.0 gives identical results).
We now use a fixed fiducial neutron decay-constant value
of τn = 880.2 s, neglecting uncertainties. Predictions from
PArthENoPE for the helium mass fraction (YP ≈ 0.2454, nucleon fraction YPBBN ≈ 0.2467 from Planck in ΛCDM) are
lower than those from the code of Pitrou et al. (2018) for the
same value of τn by ∆YP ≈ 0.0005; however, other parameter
results would be consistent to well within 0.1σ. See Sect. 7.6
for further discussion of BBN parameter uncertainties and
code variations.
Building upon many years of theoretical effort, the computation of CMB power spectra and the related likelihood functions
has now become highly efficient and robust. Our main results are
based upon the lensed CMB power spectra computed with the
August 2017 version of the camb4 Boltzmann code (Lewis et al.
2000) and parameter constraints are based on the July 2018
version of CosmoMC5 (Lewis & Bridle 2002; Lewis 2013). We
have checked that there is very good consistency between
4

these results and equivalent results computed using the class
Boltzmann code (Blas et al. 2011) and MontePython sampler (Audren et al. 2013; Brinckmann & Lesgourgues 2019).
Marginalized densities, limits, and contour plots are generated
using updated adaptive kernel density estimates (with corrections for boundary and smoothing biases) as calculated using
the getdist package6 (also part of CosmoMC), which improves
average accuracy for a given number of posterior samples compared to the version used in our previous analyses.
A few new derived parameters have been added to the output
of the CosmoMC chains to allow comparisons and combinations
with external data sets. A full description of all parameters is
provided in the tables presented in the Explanatory Supplement
(Planck Collaboration ES 2018), and parameter chains are available on the PLA.
2.2. Power spectra and likelihoods

Since the 2015 Planck data release, most of the effort on the
low-level data processing has been directed to improving the fidelity of the polarization data at low multipoles. The first results
from this effort were reported in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI
(2016) and led to a new determination of the reionization optical
depth, τ. The main results presented in this paper are based on
the 2018 HFI maps produced with the SRoll mapmaking algorithm described in detail in Planck Collaboration III (2020), supplemented with LFI data described in Planck Collaboration II
(2020).
Because Planck-HFI measures polarization by differencing the signals measured by polarization-sensitive bolometers
(PSBs), a number of instrumental effects need to be controlled to
achieve high precision in the absolute calibrations of each detector. These include: effective gain variations arising from nonlinearities in the analogue-to-digital electronics and thermal fluctuations; far-field beam characterization, including long bolometer time constants; and differences in detector bandpasses. The
SRoll mapmaking solution for the 100–353 GHz channels minimizes map residuals between all HFI detectors at a given frequency, using absolute calibrations based on the orbital dipole,
together with a bandpass-mismatch model constructed from spatial templates of the foregrounds and a parametric model characterizing the remaining systematics. We refer the reader to
Planck Collaboration III (2020) for details of the implementation of SRoll. The fidelity of the SRoll maps can be assessed using various null tests (e.g., splitting the data by halfmission, odd-even surveys, and different detector combinations)
and by the consistency of the recovered Solar dipole solution.
These tests are described in Planck Collaboration III (2020) and
demonstrate that the Solar dipole calibration is accurate to about
one part in 104 for the three lowest-frequency HFI channels.
Large-scale intensity-to-polarization leakage, caused by calibration mismatch in the SRoll maps, is then reduced to levels

estimates at higher multipoles. Correlations between the low and
high multipoles are neglected. In this paper, we have used two
independent high-multipole TT,TE,EE likelihoods.7 The Plik
likelihood, which is adopted as the baseline in this paper, is described in Sect. 2.2.1, while the CamSpec likelihood is described
in Sect. 2.2.2 and Appendix A. These two likelihoods are in
very good agreement in TT, but show small differences in TE
and EE, as described below and in the main body of this paper. Section 2.3 summarizes the Planck CMB lensing likelihood,
which is described in greater detail in Planck Collaboration VIII
(2020).
Before summarizing the high-multipole likelihoods, we
make a few remarks concerning the 2018 SRoll maps. The
main aim of the SRoll processing is to reduce the impact of
systematics at low multipoles and hence the main differences
between the 2015 and 2018 HFI maps are at low multipoles.
Compared to the 2015 HFI maps, the SRoll maps eliminate the
last 1000 HFI scanning rings (about 22 days of observations)
because these were less thermally stable than the rest of the mission. SRoll uses higher resolution maps to determine the destriping offsets compared to the 2015 maps, leading to a reduction of about 12 % in the noise levels at 143 GHz (see figure 10
of Planck Collaboration III 2020). A tighter requirement on the
reconstruction of Q and U values at each pixel leads to more
missing pixels in the 2018 maps compared to 2015. These and
other changes to the 2018 Planck maps have very little impact
on the temperature and polarization spectra at high multipoles
(as will be demonstrated explicitly in Fig. 9 below).
There are, however, data-processing effects that need to be
accounted for to create an unbiased temperature+polarization
likelihood at high multipoles from the SRoll maps. In simplified form, the power absorbed by a detector at time t on the sky
is



P(t)=G I + ρ Q cos 2(ψ(t) + ψ0 ) + U sin 2(ψ(t) + ψ0 ) +n(t), (1)
where I, Q, and U are the beam-convolved Stokes parameters
seen by the detector at time t, G is the effective gain (setting
the absolute calibration), ρ is the detector polarization efficiency,
ψ(t) is the roll angle of the satellite, ψ0 is the detector polarization angle, and n(t) is the noise. For a perfect polarizationsensitive detector, ρ = 1, while for a perfect unpolarized detector, ρ = 0. The polarization efficiencies and polarization angles
for the HFI bolometers were measured on the ground and are
reported in Rosset et al. (2010). For polarization-sensitive detectors the ground-based measurements of polarization angles
were measured to an accuracy of approximately 1◦ and the polarization efficiencies to a quoted accuracy of 0.1–0.3 %. The
SRoll mapmaking algorithm assumes the ground-based measurements of polarization angles and efficiencies, which cannot be separated because they are degenerate with each other.
Errors in the polarization angles induce leakage from E to B
modes, while errors in the polarization efficiencies lead to gain
mismatch between I, Q and U. Analysis of the Planck T B and
EB spectra (which should be zero in the absence of parityviolating physics) reported in Planck Collaboration III (2020),
◦
suggest errors in the polarization angles of <
∼ 0.5 , within the
error estimates reported in Rosset et al. (2010). However, systematic errors in the polarization efficiencies are found to be
several times larger than the Rosset et al. (2010) determinations
(which were limited to characterizations of the feed and detector

sub-assemblies and did not characterize the system in combination with the telescope) leading to effective calibration offsets
in the polarization spectra. These polarization efficiency differences, which are detector- and hence frequency-dependent, need
to be calibrated to construct a high-multipole likelihood. To give
some representative numbers, the Rosset et al. (2010) groundbased measurements estimated polarization efficiencies for the
PSBs, with typical values of 92–96 % at 100 GHz, 83–93 % at
143 GHz, and 94–95 % at 217 GHz (the three frequencies used
to construct the high-multipole polarization likelihoods). From
the SRoll maps, we find evidence of systematic errors in the polarization efficiencies of order 0.5–1 % at 100 and 217 GHz and
up to 1.5 % at 143 GHz. Differences between the main beams of
the PSBs introduce temperature-to-polarization leakage at high
multipoles. We use the QuickPol estimates of the temperaturepolarization beam transfer function matrices, as described in
Hivon et al. (2017), to correct for temperature-to-polarization
leakage. Inaccuracies in the corrections for effective polarization efficiencies and temperature-to-polarization leakage are the
main contributors to systematic errors in the Planck polarization
spectra at high multipoles.
In principle, B-mode polarization spectra contain information about lensing and primordial tensor modes. However, for
Planck, B-mode polarization spectra are strongly noise dominated on all angular scales. Given the very limited information
contained in the Planck B-mode spectra (and the increased complexity involved) we do not include B-mode power spectra in
the likelihoods; however, for an estimate of the lensing B-mode
power spectrum see Planck Collaboration VIII 2020, hereafter
PL2018.
2.2.1. The baseline Plik likelihood

The Plik high-multipole likelihood (described in detail in
Planck Collaboration V 2020, hereafter PPL18) is a Gaussian
approximation to the probability distributions of the T T , EE,
and T E angular power spectra, with semi-analytic covariance
matrices calculated assuming a fiducial cosmology. It includes
multipoles in the range 30 ≤ ` ≤ 2508 for T T and 30 ≤ ` ≤ 1996
for T E and EE, and is constructed from half-mission crossspectra measured from the 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz HFI frequency maps.
The TT likelihood uses four half-mission cross-spectra, with
different multipole cuts to avoid multipole regions where noise
dominates due to the limited resolution of the beams and to ensure foreground contamination is correctly handled by our foreground model: 100 × 100 (` = 30–1197); 143 × 143 (` = 30–
1996); 143 × 217 (` = 30–2508); and 217 × 217 (` = 30–
2508). The TE and EE likelihoods also include the 100×143 and
100 × 217 cross-spectra to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and
have different multipole cuts: 100 × 100 (` = 30–999); 100 × 143
(` = 30–999); 100 × 217 (` = 505–999); 143 × 143 (` = 30–
1996); 143 × 217 (` = 505–1996); and 217 × 217 (` = 505–
1996). The 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz intensity maps are masked
to reduce Galactic dust, CO, extended sources, and point-source
contamination (a different point-source mask is used at each frequency), as well as badly-conditioned/missing pixels, effectively
retaining 66, 57, and 47 % of the sky after apodization, respectively (see equation 10 in PCP15 for a definition of the effective
sky fraction). The apodization is applied to reduce the maskinduced correlations between modes, and reduces the effective
sky fraction by about 10 % compared to the unapodized masks.
The 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz maps in polarization are masked
only for Galactic contamination and badly-conditioned or miss5

ing pixels, effectively retaining 70, 50, and 41 % of the sky after
apodization, respectively.
The baseline likelihood uses the different frequency power
spectra without coadding them, modelling the foreground and
instrumental effects with nuisance parameters that are marginalized over at the parameter estimation level, both in temperature
and in polarization. To reduce the size of the covariance matrix
and data vector, the baseline Plik likelihood uses binned band
powers, which give an excellent approximation to the unbinned
likelihood for smooth theoretical power spectra. Unbinned versions of the likelihoods are also available and provide almost
identical results to the binned spectra for all of the theoretical
models considered in our main parameter grid (Sect. 7.1).
The major changes with respect to the 2015 Plik likelihood
are the following.
• Beams. In 2015, the effective beam window functions were
calculated assuming the same average sky fraction at all frequencies. In this new release, we apply beam window functions calculated for the specific sky fraction retained at each frequency.
The impact on the spectra is small, at the level of approximately
0.1 % at ` = 2000.
• Dust modelling in T T . The use of intensity-thresholded
point-source masks modifies the power spectrum of the Galactic
dust emission, since such masks include point-like bright
Galactic dust regions. Because these point-source masks are frequency dependent, a different dust template is constructed from
the 545-GHz maps for each power spectrum used in the likelihood. This differs from the approach adopted in 2015, which
used a Galactic dust template with the same shape at all frequencies. As in 2015, the Galactic dust amplitudes are then left
free to vary, with priors determined from cross-correlating the
frequency maps used in the likelihood with the 545-GHz maps.
These changes produce small correlated shifts in the dust, cosmic infrared background (CIB), and point-source amplitudes,
but have negligible impact on cosmological parameters.
• Dust modelling in T E and EE. Dust amplitudes in T E
are varied with Gaussian priors as in 2015, while in EE we
fix the dust amplitudes to the values obtained using the crosscorrelations with 353-GHz maps, for the reasons detailed in
PPL18. The choice of fixing the dust amplitudes in EE has a
small impact (of the order of 0.2 σ) on the base-ΛCDM results
when combining into the full “TT,TE,EE,” Plik likelihood because EE has lower statistical power compared to T T or T E;
however, dust modelling in EE has a greater effect when parameters are estimated from EE alone (e.g., fixing the dust amplitude in EE lowers ns by 0.8 σ, compared to allowing the dust
amplitude to vary.)
• Correction of systematic effects in the polarization spectra. In the 2015 Planck analysis, small differences in the interfrequency comparisons of T E and EE foreground-corrected polarization power spectra were identified and attributed to systematics such as temperature-to-polarization leakage and polarization efficiencies, which had not been characterized adequately
at the time. For the 2018 analysis we have applied the following
corrections to the Plik spectra.
– Beam-leakage correction. The T E and EE pseudo-spectra
are corrected for temperature-to-polarization leakage caused
by beam mismatch, using polarized beam matrices computed with the QuickPol code described in Hivon et al.
(2017). The beam-leakage correction template is calculated
using fiducial theoretical spectra computed from the bestfit ΛCDM cosmology fitted to the T T data, together with
QuickPol estimates of the HFI polarized beam transferfunction matrices. This template is then included in our data
6

model. The correction for beam leakage has a larger impact
on T E than on EE. For base-ΛCDM cosmology, correcting
for the leakage induces shifts of <
∼ 1 σ when constraining parameters with TT,TE,EE, namely +1.1 σ for ωb , −0.7 σ for
ωc , +0.7 σ for θMC , and +0.5 σ for ns , with smaller changes
for other parameters.
– Effective polarization efficiencies. We estimate the effective
polarization efficiencies of the SRoll maps by comparing
the frequency polarization power spectra to fiducial spectra
computed from the best-fit base-ΛCDM model determined
from the temperature data. The details and limitations of this
procedure are described in PPL18 and briefly summarized
further below. Applying these polarization efficiency estimates, we find relatively small shifts to the base-ΛCDM parameters determined from the TT,TE,EE likelihood, with the
largest shifts in ωb (+0.4 σ), ωc (+0.2 σ), and ns (+0.2 σ).
The parameter shifts are small because the polarization efficiencies at different frequencies partially average out in the
coadded T E spectra (see also Fig. 9, discussed in Sect. 3).
– Correlated noise in auto-frequency cross-spectra and subpixel effects. The likelihood is built using half-mission crossspectra to avoid noise biases from auto-spectra. However,
small residual correlated noise contributions may still be
present. The pixelization of the maps introduces an additional noise term because the centroid of the “hits” distribution of the detector samples in each pixel does not necessarily lie at the pixel centre. The impact of correlated noise
is evaluated using the end-to-end simulations described in
Planck Collaboration III (2020), while the impact of subpixel effects is estimated with analytic calculations. Both effects are included in the Plik data model, but have negligible
impact on cosmological parameters.
Of the systematic effects listed above, correction for the polarization efficiencies has the largest uncertainty. We model these
factors as effective polarization calibration parameters cνEE , defined at the power spectrum level for a frequency spectrum ν×ν.8
To correct for errors in polarization efficiencies and large-scale
beam-transfer function errors, we recalibrate the T E and EE
spectra against a fiducial theoretical model to minimize

it is not possible to inter-calibrate the spectra to a precision of
better than 1 % without invoking a reference model. The fiducial theoretical spectra C`Th contained in C Th are derived from
the best-fit temperature data alone, assuming the base-ΛCDM
model, adding the beam-leakage model and fixing the Galactic
dust amplitudes to the central values of the priors obtained from
using the 353-GHz maps. This is clearly a model-dependent procedure, but given that we fit over a restricted range of multipoles,
where the T T spectra are measured to cosmic variance, the resulting polarization calibrations are insensitive to small changes
in the underlying cosmological model.
In principle, the polarization efficiencies found by fitting the
T E spectra should be consistent with those obtained from EE.

However, the polarization efficiency at 143 × 143, c143

from the EE spectrum is about 2 σ lower than that derived from
T E (where the σ is the uncertainty of the T E estimate, of the
order of 0.02). This difference may be a statistical fluctuation or
it could be a sign of residual systematics that project onto calibration parameters differently in EE and T E. We have investigated ways of correcting for effective polarization efficiencies:

adopting the estimates from EE (which are about a factor of
2 more precise than T E) for both the T E and EE spectra (we
call this the “map-based” approach); or applying independent
estimates from T E and EE (the “spectrum-based” approach). In

parameters compared with ignoring spectrum-based polarization efficiency corrections entirely; the largest of these shifts
are +0.5 σ in ωb , +0.1 σ in ωc , and +0.3 σ in ns (to be compared to +0.4 σ in ωb , +0.2 σ in ωc , and +0.2 σ in ns for
the map-based case). Furthermore, if we introduce the phenomenological AL parameter (discussed in much greater detail in
Sect. 6.2), using the baseline TT,TE,EE+lowE likelihood gives
AL = 1.180 ± 0.065, differing from unity by 2.7σ (the value of
AL is unchanged with respect to the case where we ignore polar efficiencies entirely, 1.180 ± 0.065). Switching to spectrumbased polarization efficiency corrections changes this estimate
to AL = 1.142 ± 0.066 differing from unity by 2.1σ. Readers
of this paper should therefore not over-interpret the Planck polarization results and should be aware of the sensitivity of these
results to small changes in the specific choices and assumptions
made in constructing the polarization likelihoods, which are not
accounted for in the likelihood error model. To emphasize this
point, we also give results from the CamSpec likelihood (see,
e.g., Table 1), described in the next section, which has been constructed independently of Plik. We also note that if we apply
the CamSpec polarization masks and spectrum-based polarization efficiencies in the Plik likelihood, then the cosmological
parameters from the two likelihoods are in close agreement.
The coadded 2018 Plik temperature and polarization power
spectra and residuals with respect to the base-ΛCDM model are
shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
2.2.2. The CamSpec likelihood

The CamSpec temperature likelihood was used as the baseline
for the first analysis of cosmological parameters from Planck,
reported in PCP13, and was described in PPL13. A detailed description of CamSpec and its generalization to polarization is
given in Efstathiou & Gratton (2019). For PCP15, the CamSpec
temperature likelihood was unaltered from that adopted in
PPL13, except that we used half-mission cross-spectra instead
of detector-set cross-spectra and made minor modifications to
the foreground model. For this set of papers, the CamSpec temperature analysis uses identical input maps and masks as Plik
and is unaltered from PCP15, except for the following details.
• In previous versions we used half-ring difference maps (constructed from the first and second halves of the scanning rings
within each pointing period) to estimate noise. In this release we
have used differences between maps constructed from odd and
even rings. The use of odd-even differences makes almost no difference to the temperature analysis, since the temperature spectra that enter the likelihood are signal dominated over most of
the multipole range. However, the odd-even noise estimates give
higher noise levels than half-ring difference estimates at multipoles <
∼ 500 (in qualitative agreement with end-to-end simulations), and this improves the χ2 of the polarization spectra. This
differs from the Plik likelihood, which uses the half-ring difference maps to estimate the noise levels, together with a correction
to compensate for correlated noise, as described in PPL18.
• In PCP15, we used power-spectrum templates for the CIB from
the halo models described in Planck Collaboration XXX (2014).
The overall amplitude of the CIB power spectrum at 217 GHz
was allowed to vary as one of the “nuisance” parameters in the
likelihood, but the relative amplitudes at 143×217 and 143×143
were fixed to the values given by the model. In the 2018 analysis,
we retain the template shapes from Planck Collaboration XXX
(2014), but allow free amplitudes at 217 × 217, 143 × 217,
and 143 × 143. The CIB is ignored at 100 GHz. We made
these changes to the 2018 CamSpec likelihood to reduce any

source of systematic bias associated with the specific model of
Planck Collaboration XXX (2014), since this model is uncertain
at low frequencies and fails to match Herschel-SPIRE measurements (Viero et al. 2013) of the CIB anisotropies at 350 and
500 µm for ` >
∼ 3000 (Mak et al. 2017). This change was implemented to see whether it had any impact on the value of the
lensing parameter AL (see Sect. 6.2); however, it has a negligible effect on AL or on other cosmological parameters. The Plik
likelihood retains the 2015 model for the CIB.
• In PCP15 we used a single functional form for the Galactic
dust power spectrum template, constructed by computing differences of 545 × 545 power spectra determined using different
masks. The dust template was then rescaled to match the dust
amplitudes at lower frequencies for the masks used to form the
likelihood. In the 2018 CamSpec likelihood we use dust templates computed from the 545 × 545 spectra, using masks with
exactly the same point-source holes as those used to compute the
100×100, 143×143, 143×217, and 217×217 power spectra that
are used in the likelihood. The Plik likelihood adopts a similar
approach and the CamSpec and Plik dust templates are in very
good agreement.
In forming the temperature likelihood, we apply multipole
cuts to the temperature spectra as follows: `min = 30, `max =
1200 for the 100 × 100 spectrum; `min = 30, `max = 2000 for the
143 × 143 spectrum; and `min = 500, `max = 2500 for 143 × 217
and 217 × 217. As discussed in previous papers, the `min cuts
applied to the 143 × 217 and 217 × 217 spectra are imposed to
reduce any potential systematic biases arising from Galactic dust
at these frequencies. A foreground model is included in computing the covariance matrices, assuming that foregrounds are
isotropic and Gaussian. This model underestimates the contribution of Galactic dust to the covariances, since this component is
anisotropic on the sky. However, dust always makes a very small
contribution to the covariance matrices in the CamSpec likelihood. Mak et al. (2017) describe a simple model to account for
the Galactic dust contributions to covariance matrices.
It is important to emphasize that these changes to the 2018
CamSpec TT likelihood are largely cosmetic and have very little impact on cosmological parameters. This can be assessed by
comparing the CamSpec TT results reported in this paper with
those in PCP15. The main changes in cosmological parameters
from the TT likelihood come from the tighter constraints on the
optical depth, τ, adopted in this paper.
In polarization, CamSpec uses a different methodology
to Plik. In temperature, there are a number of frequencydependent foregrounds at high multipoles that are described by
a physically motivated parametric model containing “nuisance”
parameters. These nuisance parameters are sampled, along with
cosmological parameters, during Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) exploration of the likelihood. The TT likelihood is
therefore a power-spectrum-based component-separation tool
and it is essential to retain cross-power spectra for each distinct frequency combination. For the Planck T E and EE spectra, however, Galactic dust is by far the dominant foreground
contribution. At the multipoles and sensitivities accessible to
Planck, polarized point sources make a negligible contribution to
the foreground (as verified by ACTPol and SPTpol; Louis et al.
2017; Henning et al. 2018), so the only foreground that needs to
be subtracted is polarized Galactic dust emission. As described
in PCP15, we subtract polarized dust emission from each T E/ET
and EE spectrum using the 353-GHz half-mission maps. This
is done in an analogous way to the construction of 545-GHzcleaned temperature maps described in PCP15 and Appendix A.
Since the 353-GHz maps are noisy at high multipoles we use
9

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

the cleaned spectra at multipoles ≤ 300 and extrapolate the dust
model to higher multipoles by fitting power laws to the dust estimates at lower multipoles.
The polarization spectra are then corrected for temperatureto-polarization leakage and effective polarization efficiencies as
described below, assuming a fiducial theoretical power spectrum. The corrected T E/ET spectra and EE spectra for all halfmission cross-spectra constructed from 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz
maps are then coadded to form a single T E spectrum and a single EE spectrum for the CamSpec likelihood. The polarization
part of the CamSpec likelihood therefore contains no nuisance
parameters other than overall calibration factors cT E and cEE for
the T E and EE spectra. Since the CamSpec likelihood uses coadded T E and EE spectra, we do not need to bin the spectra to form
a TT,TE,EE likelihood. The polarization masks used in CamSpec
are based on 353–143 GHz polarization maps that are degraded
in resolution and thresholded on P = (Q2 + U 2 )1/2 . The default
CamSpec polarization mask used for the 2018 analysis preserves
a fraction fsky = 57.7 % and is apodized to give an effective sky
W
fraction (see equation 10 of PCP15) of fsky
= 47.7 %. We use
the same polarization mask for all frequencies. The CamSpec
polarization masks differ from those used in the Plik likelihood, which uses intensity-thresholded masks in polarization
(and therefore a larger effective sky area in polarization, as described in the previous section).
To construct covariance matrices, temperature-topolarization leakage corrections, and effective polarization
efficiencies, we need to adopt a fiducial model. For the 2018
analysis, we adopted the best-fit CamSpec base-ΛCDM model
from PCP15 to construct a likelihood from the 2018 temperature
maps. We then ran a minimizer on the TT likelihood, imposing a
prior of τ = 0.05 ± 0.02, and the best-fit base-ΛCDM cosmology
was adopted as our fiducial model. To deal with temperatureto-polarization leakage, we used the QuickPol polarized beam
matrices to compute corrections to the T E and EE spectra
assuming the fiducial model. The temperature-to-polarization
leakage corrections are relatively small for T E spectra (although
they have some impact on cosmological parameters, consistent
with the behaviour of the Plik likelihood described in the
previous section), but are negligible for EE spectra.
To correct for effective polarization efficiencies (including
large-scale transfer functions arising from errors in the polarized
beams) we recalibrated each T E, ET , and EE spectrum against
the fiducial model spectra by minimizing

with respect to αP , where C`D is the beam-corrected data spectrum (T E, ET , or EE) corrected for temperature-to-polarization
leakage, M is the covariance matrix for the appropriate spectrum,
and the sums extend over 200 ≤ ` ≤ 1000. We calibrate each T E
and EE spectrum individually, rather than computing map-based
polarization calibrations. Although there is a good correspondence between spectrum-based calibrations and map-based calibrations, we find evidence for some differences, particularly for
the 143 × 143 EE spectrum in agreement with the Plik analysis.
Unlike Plik, we adopt spectrum-based calibrations of polarization efficiencies in preference to map-based calibrations.
As in temperature, we apply multipole cuts to the polarization spectra prior to coaddition in order to reduce sensitivity
to dust subtraction, beam estimation, and noise modelling. For
T E/ET spectra we use: `min = 30 and `max = 1200 for the
100 × 100, 100 × 143 and 100 × 217 spectra; `min = 30 and
10

`max = 2000 for 143 × 143 and 143 × 217; and `min = 500
and `max = 2500 for the 217 × 217 cross-spectrum. For EE,
we use: `min = 30 and `max = 1000 for 100 × 100; `min = 30
and `max = 1200 for 100 × 143; `min = 200 and `max = 1200 for
100 × 217; `min = 30 and `max = 1500 for 143 × 143; `min = 300
and `max = 2000 for 143 × 217; and `min = 500 and `max = 2000
for 217×217. Since dust is subtracted from the polarization spectra, we do not include a dust model in the polarization covariance matrices. Note that at low multipoles, ` <
∼ 300, Galactic
dust dominates over the CMB signal in EE at all frequencies.
We experimented with different polarization masks and different
multipole cuts and found stable results from the CamSpec polarization likelihood.
To summarize, for the T T data Plik and CamSpec use very
similar methodologies and a similar foreground model, and the
power spectra used in the likelihoods only differ in the handling of missing pixels. As a result, there is close agreement
between the two temperature likelihoods. In polarization, different polarization masks are applied and different methods are
used for correcting Galactic dust, effective polarization calibrations, and temperature-to-polarization leakage. In addition, the
polarization covariance matrices differ at low multipoles. As described in Appendix A, the two codes give similar results in polarization for base ΛCDM and most of the extensions of ΛCDM
considered in this paper, and there would be no material change
to most of the science conclusions in this paper were one to
use the CamSpec likelihood in place of Plik. However, in cases
where there are differences that could
P have an impact on the scientific interpretation (e.g., for AL , mν , and ΩK ) we show results from both codes. This should give the reader an impression
of the sensitivity of the science results to different methodologies and choices made in constructing the polarization blocks of
the high-multipole likelihoods.
2.2.3. The low-` likelihood

The HFI low-` polarization likelihood is based on the fullmission HFI 100-GHz and 143-GHz Stokes Q and U lowresolution maps, cleaned through a template-fitting procedure
using LFI 30-GHz (Planck Collaboration II 2020) and HFI 353GHz maps,9 which are used as tracers of polarized synchrotron
and thermal dust, respectively (for details about the cleaning
procedure see PPL18). Power spectra are calculated based on a
quadratic maximum-likelihood estimation of the cross-spectrum
between the 100- and 143-GHz data, and the multipole range
used spans ` = 2 to ` = 29.
We only use the EE likelihood (“lowE”) for the main
parameter results in this paper. The likelihood code, called
SimAll, is based on the power spectra. It is constructed
using an extension of the SimBaL algorithm presented in
Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016), using 300 end-to-end
simulations characterizing the HFI noise and residual systematics (see Planck Collaboration III 2020, for details) to build an
empirical probability distribution of the EE spectra (ignoring the
off-diagonal correlations). The T E spectrum at low multipoles
does not provide tight constraints compared to EE because of
cosmic variance. However, PPL18 discusses the T E spectra at
low multipoles constructed by cross-correlating the Commander
9

The polarized synchrotron component is fitted only at 100 GHz,
being negligible at 143 GHz. For the polarized dust component, following the prescription contained in Planck Collaboration III (2020),
the low-` HFI polarization likelihood uses the 353-GHz polarizationsensitive-bolometer-only map.

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

component-separated map with the 100- and 143-GHz maps.
The T E spectra show excess variance compared to simulations
at low multipoles, most notably at ` = 5 and at ` = 18 and 19,
for reasons that are not understood. No attempt has been made
to fold in Commander component-separation errors in the statistical analysis. We have therefore excluded the T E spectrum at
low multipoles (with the added benefit of simplifying the construction of the SimAll likelihood). Little information is lost
by discarding the T E spectrum. Evidently, further work is required to understand the behaviour of T E at low multipoles;
however, as discussed in PPL18, the τ constraint derived from
T E to `max = 10 (τ = 0.051 ± 0.015) is consistent with results
derived from the SimAll EE likelihood summarized below.
Using the SimAll likelihood combined with the low-` temperature Commander likelihood (see Planck Collaboration IV
2020), varying ln(1010 As ) and τ, but fixing other cosmological
parameters to those of a fiducial base-ΛCDM model (with parameters very close to those of the baseline ΛCDM cosmology
in this paper), PPL18 reports the optical depth measurement10
τ = 0.0506 ± 0.0086

(68 %, lowE).

(4)

This is significantly tighter than the LFI-based constraint used in
the 2015 release (τ = 0.067 ± 0.022), and differs by about half a
sigma from the result of Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016)
(τ = 0.055 ± 0.009). The latter change is driven mainly by the
removal of the last 1000 scanning rings in the 2018 SRoll maps,
higher variance in the end-to-end simulations, and differences in
the 30-GHz map used as a synchrotron tracer (see appendix A
of Planck Collaboration II 2020). The impact of the tighter optical depth measurement on cosmological parameters compared to
the 2015 release is discussed in Sect. 3.6. The error model in the
final likelihood does not fully include all modelling uncertainties and differences between likelihood codes, but the different
approaches lead to estimates of τ that are consistent within their
respective 1 σ errors.
In addition to the default SimAll lowE likelihood used in
this paper, the LFI polarization likelihood has also been updated for the 2018 release, as described in detail in PPL18. It
gives consistent results to SimAll, but with larger errors (τ =
0.063 ± 0.020); we give a more detailed comparison of the various τ constraints in Sect. 7.8.
The low-` temperature likelihood is based on maps from
the Commander component-separation algorithm, as discussed in
detail in Planck Collaboration IV (2020), with a Gibbs-samplebased Blackwell-Rao likelihood that accurately accounts for the
non-Gaussian shape of the posterior at low multipoles, as in
2015. The CMB maps that are used differ in several ways from
the 2015 analysis. Firstly, since the 2018 analysis does not produce individual bolometer maps (since it is optimized to reduce large-scale polarization systematics) the number of foreground components that can be constrained is reduced compared
to 2015. The 2018 Commander analysis only fits the CMB, a single general low-frequency power-law component, thermal dust,
and a single CO component with spatially constant line ratios
between 100, 217, and 353 GHz. Secondly, the 2018 analysis is
10

The corresponding marginalized amplitude parameter is
ln(1010 As ) = 2.924 ± 0.052, which gives As about 10 % lower
than the value obtained from the joint fits in Sect. 3. The τ constraints
quoted here are lower than the joint results, since the small-scale
power has a preference for higher As (and hence higher τ for the
well-measured As e−2τ combination) at high multipoles, related to the
preference for more lensing discussed in Sect. 6.

based only on Planck data and so does not including the WMAP
and Haslam 408-MHz maps. Finally, in order to be conservative with respect to CO emission, the sky fraction has been reduced to 86 % coverage, compared to 93 % in 2015. The net effect is a small increase in errors, and the best-fit data points are
correspondingly slightly more scattered compared to 2015. The
(arbitrary) normalization of the Commander likelihood was also
changed, so that a theory power spectrum equal to the best-fit
power spectrum points will, by definition, give χ2eff = 0.
2.2.4. Likelihood notation

Throughout this paper, we adopt the following labels for likelihoods: (i) Planck TT+lowE denotes the combination of the high` TT likelihood at multipoles ` ≥ 30, the low-` temperatureonly Commander likelihood, and the low-` EE likelihood from
SimAll; (ii) labels such as Planck TE+lowE denote the TE likelihood at ` ≥ 30 plus the low-` EE SimAll likelihood; and (iii)
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE denotes the combination of the combined likelihood using T T , T E, and EE spectra at ` ≥ 30, the
low-` temperature Commander likelihood, and the low-` SimAll
EE likelihood. For brevity we sometimes drop the “Planck”
qualifier where it should be clear, and unless otherwise stated
high-` results are based on the Plik likelihood. T E correlations
at ` ≤ 29 are not included in any of the results presented in this
paper.
2.2.5. Uncertainties on cosmological parameters

To maximize the accuracy of the results, various choices can
be made in the construction of the high-multipole likelihoods.
Examples of these are the sky area, noise models, multipole
ranges, frequencies, foreground parameterization, and priors, as
detailed for this release of Planck data in PPL18. The cosmological parameters and their uncertainties depend on these options.
It is therefore necessary to test the sensitivity of the results with
respect to such choices. In particular, when removing or adding
independent information (e.g., by lifting or adding priors, or by
measuring parameters from different multipole ranges), we do
expect cosmological parameters to shift. The crucial question,
however, is whether these are in agreement with statistical expectations. If they are consistent with being statistical excursions, then the noise model, along with foreground and instrumental nuisance parameters (e.g., polarization efficiencies), may
be a consistent representation of the data. In this case, the uncertainties quoted in this paper should accurately describe the
combined noise and sample variance due to finite data. Different
choices of sky area, multipole range, etc., will produce changes
in the parameters, but they will be adequately described by the
quoted uncertainties. On the other hand, if the shifts do not agree
with statistical expectations, they might be an indication of unmodelled systematic effects.
In PPL18 we discuss a series of tests indicating the overall
robustness of our results. Internal to the Plik likelihood code,
we consider the CMB spectra, errors, and resulting parameters
as we vary the input data, ` range, sky area, etc. We also consider the effect of known sources of systematic uncertainty, such
as high-frequency oscillations in the raw time-ordered data and
temperature-to-polarization leakage. We further test the baseline likelihood using extensive simulations; these tests demonstrate the solidity of our results. As a specific example, when
lifting all priors on nuisance parameters (such as calibration and
foregrounds), the posterior mean on the number of relativistic
11

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

species Neff shifts upwards by about 1 σ. We quantify in PPL18
that this is statistically not anomalous, since lifting priors reduces information and, as a consequence, error bars also increase.
Only in a small number of areas, do such tests show mild
internal disagreements at the level of spectra and parameters.
One example is the higher than expected χ2 of the Plik TE
frequency-likelihood, which can be traced back to a small mismatch between the different cross-frequency spectra. When we
co-add the foreground-cleaned frequency TE spectra into one
CMB spectrum (which is less sensitive to such a mismatch), the
related χ2 is in better agreement with expectations. A second example is the choice of polarization-efficiency corrections, which
has a small impact on the final results and is further discussed
below.
We have also compared the results from the Plik likelihood
with those obtained with CamSpec in Sects. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and
Appendix A, as well as in PPL18 (see also Efstathiou & Gratton
2019). Some of the likelihood choices (e.g., sky area and multipole range) will give different detailed results within the expected sample variance. Others, such as the models for noise
(bias-corrected half-ring difference for Plik versus odd-even
rings for CamSpec) and polarization efficiency, may give a hint
of residual systematic uncertainties. If we restrict ourselves to
temperature, the Plik and CamSpec likelihoods are in excellent
accord, with most parameters agreeing to better than 0.5 σ (0.2 σ
on the ΛCDM model). On the other hand, we find indications
(discussed in more detail in PPL18) that the polarization efficiencies of the frequency-channel maps differ when measured in
the T E or EE spectra, and the Plik and CamSpec likelihoods
have explored different choices of polarization efficiency corrections. This and polarization-noise modelling may be responsible
for differences in the details of the resulting polarization spectra
and parameters.
For the base-ΛCDM model, the results from Plik and
CamSpec for the TT,TE,EE likelihoods are in good agreement
(see Table 1), again with most parameters agreeing to better than
0.5 σ. We also find differences between the Plik and CamSpec
TTTEEE likelihoods for some extended models, especially for
the single-parameter extensions with AL (at 0.7 σ) and ΩK (at
0.5 σ); these differences are discussed in Sects. 6.2 and 7.3, respectively, where we show results for both likelihoods. For both
AL and ΩK , the Plik TT,TE,EE likelihood pulls away from the
base-ΛCDM model with a slightly higher significance than the
CamSpec TT,TE,EE likelihood. The is due, at least in part, to
the choice of how to model polarization efficiencies, as discussed in PPL18. For the ΩK case, for example, the ∆χ2 between the ΛCDM and ΛCDM+ΩK models for TT,TE,EE+lowE
is ∆χ2 = 11, of which 8.3 ∆χ points are due to the improvement of the Plik TT,TE,EE likelihood. Using spectrum-based
polarization efficiencies, instead of map-based ones11 reduces
that total difference to ∆χ2 = 5.2, of which ∆χ2 = 4.6 is due
to the Plik likelihood. This is in agreement with the ∆χ2 value
obtained for these models by CamSpec, which uses spectrumbased polarization efficiencies, with ∆χ2 = 4.3.
Other details of choices in the likelihood functions impact
the difference in parameters; however, these comprise both expected statistical fluctuations (due to differing raw data cuts
11

As explained in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, the “map-based” approach applies the same polarization efficiency corrections estimated
from EE to both the T E and EE spectra, while the “spectrum-based”
approach applies independent estimates obtained from T E and EE to
the T E and EE spectra, respectively.
12

and sky coverage) and possible residual systematic errors. For
both extended models the Planck TTTEEE likelihoods are usually combined with other data to break parameter degeneracies.
For these parameters, the addition of either Planck lensing or
BAO data overwhelms any differences between the Plik and
CamSpec likelihoods and so we find almost identical results.
In this paper we therefore do not explicitly model an increase
in error bars due to these residual systematic errors — any such
characterization would inevitably be incomplete, and it would
also be impossible to give the necessary probabilistic characterization required for meaningful quantitative error bars. Instead
our best-fit values, posterior means, errors and limits should (as
always) be considered as conditional on the cosmological model
and our best knowledge of the Planck instruments and astrophysical foregrounds, as captured by the baseline likelihoods.
2.3. The CMB lensing likelihood

The CMB photons that arrive here today traverse almost the entire observable Universe. Along the way their paths are deflected
by gradients in the gravitational potentials associated with inhomogeneities in the Universe (Blanchard & Schneider 1987). The
dominant effects (e.g., Lewis & Challinor 2006; Hanson et al.
2010) are a smoothing of the acoustic peaks, conversion of Emode polarization to B-mode polarization, and generation of a
connected 4-point function, each of which can be measured in
high angular resolution, low-noise observations, such as those
from Planck.
Planck was the first experiment to measure the lensing signal
to sufficient precision for it to become important for the determination of cosmological parameters, providing sensitivity to parameters that affect the late-time expansion, geometry, and clustering (Planck Collaboration XVII 2014, hereafter PL2013). In
Planck Collaboration XV (2016, hereafter PL2015) the Planck
lensing reconstruction was improved by including polarization
information. The Planck lensing measurement is still the most
significant detection of CMB lensing to date. In this final data
release we report a measurement of the power spectrum of the
lensing potential, C Lφφ , from the 4-point function, with a precision of around 2.6 % on the amplitude, as discussed in detail
in PL2018. We demonstrate the robustness of the reconstruction
to a variety of tests over lensing multipoles 8 ≤ L ≤ 400, and
conservatively restrict the likelihood to this range to reduce the
impact of possible systematics. Compared to 2015, the multipole
range is extended from Lmin = 40 down to Lmin = 8, with other
analysis changes mostly introducing random fluctuations in the
band powers, due to improvements in the noise modelling and
the somewhat different mixture of frequencies being used in the
foreground-cleaned SMICA maps (see Planck Collaboration IV
2020). The signal-to-noise per multipole is almost the same
as in 2015, which, combined with the wider multipole range,
makes the likelihood just slightly more powerful than in 2015.
CMB lensing can provide complementary information to the
Planck CMB power spectra, since it it probes much lower redshifts, including z <
∼ 2, when dark energy becomes important.
The lensing effect depends on the propagation of photons on
null geodesics, and hence depends on the background geometry
and Weyl potential (the combination of scalar metric perturbations that determines the Weyl spacetime curvature tensor; see
e.g. Lewis & Challinor (2006)).
We approximate the lensing likelihood as Gaussian in the
estimated band powers, making perturbative corrections for the
small dependence of band powers on the cosmology, as de-

scribed in PL2015. We neglect correlations between the 2and 4-point functions, which are negligible at Planck sensitivity (Schmittfull et al. 2013; Peloton et al. 2017). As in PL2015,
band powers at multipoles L > 400 are less robust than over
8 ≤ L ≤ 400, with some evidence for a curl-test failure, and possibly also systematic differences between individual frequencies
that we were unable to resolve. Multipoles at L < 8 are very
sensitive to the large mean-field correction on these scales, and
hence are sensitive to the fidelity of the simulations used to estimate the mean field. As described above, our baseline cosmological results therefore conservatively use only the multipole range
8 ≤ L ≤ 400.
The Planck measurements of C Lφφ are plotted in Fig. 3, where
they are compared to the predicted spectrum from the best-fitting
base-ΛCDM model of Sect. 3, and Fig. 4 shows the corresponding broad redshift ranges that contribute to the lensing band powers in the ΛCDM model. Fig. 3 shows that the lensing data are in
excellent agreement with the predictions inferred from the CMB
power spectra in the base-ΛCDM model (χ2eff = 8.9 for 9 binned
conservative band-power measurements, χ2eff = 14.0 for 14 bins
over the full multipole range; we discuss agreement in extensions to the ΛCDM model in more detail below). The lensing
data prefer lensing power spectra that are slightly tilted towards
less power on small scales compared to the best fit to the CMB
power spectra. This small tilt pulls joint constraints a small fraction of an error bar towards parameters that give a lower lensing
amplitude on small scales. Parameter results from the full multipole range would be a little tighter and largely consistent with
the conservative band powers, although preferring slightly lower
fluctuation amplitudes (see PL2018).

The constraints of Eq. (5) and (6) in are in very good agreement
with the estimates derived from the Planck power spectra and are
independent of how the Planck power spectra depend on the cosmological model at high multipoles. This is a strong test of the
internal consistency of the Planck data. The Planck lensing constraints in Eqs. (5) and (6), and the consistency of these results
with the Planck power spectrum likelihoods, should be borne in
mind when comparing Planck results with other astrophysical
data (e.g., direct measurements of H0 and galaxy shear surveys,
see Sect. 5).
In this paper, we focus on joint constraints with the main
Planck power spectrum results, where the lensing power spectrum tightens measurements of the fluctuation amplitude and improves constraints on extended models, especially when allowing for spatial curvature.
A peculiar feature of the Planck TT likelihood, reported in
PCP13 and PCP15, is the favouring of high values for the lens13

ing consistency parameter AL (at about 2.5 σ). This result is discussed in detail in Sect. 6.2. It is clear from Fig. 3, however, that
the Planck lensing likelihood prefers values of AL close to unity
and cosmological parameters that are close to those of the bestfit base-ΛCDM parameters derived from the Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE+lensing likelihood (i.e., without allowing AL to vary).

since the polarization at recombination is sourced by quadrupolar flows in the photon fluid, which are out of phase with the
density perturbations. The polarization spectra can, however, be
used to measure the same acoustic scale parameter, giving a
stringent test on the assumption of purely adiabatic perturbation
driving the oscillations. From the polarization spectra we find

The Planck measurement of seven acoustic peaks in the CMB
temperature power spectrum allows cosmological parameters to
be constrained extremely accurately. In previous papers, we have
focussed on parameters derived from the T T power spectrum.
The T E and EE polarization spectra provide a powerful consistency check on the underlying model and also help to break some
partial parameter degeneracies. The goal of this section is to explore the consistency of cosmological parameters of the baseΛCDM cosmology determined from T T , T E, and EE spectra
and to present results from the combinations of these spectra,
which are significantly more precise that those determined using
T T alone.
Figure 5 shows 2-dimensional marginalized constraints on
the six MCMC sampling parameters of the base-ΛCDM model
used to explore the parameter posteriors, plotted against the following derived parameters: the Hubble constant H0 , late-time
clustering amplitude σ8 and matter density parameter Ωm (defined including a 0.06-eV mass neutrino). Table 1 gives individual parameter constraints using our baseline parameter combination Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing. These represent the
legacy results on the cosmological ΛCDM parameters from the
Planck satellite, and are currently the most precise measurements coming from a single CMB experiment. We give the bestfit values, as well as the marginalized posterior mean values,
along with the corresponding 68 % probability intervals. Table 1
also quantifies the small changes in parameters that are found
when using the Plik and CamSpec high-` polarization analyses
described in Sect. 2.2 and Appendix A. Table 2 gives marginalized parameter constraints from the various CMB spectra, individually and without CMB lensing, including a wider variety of
derived parameters of physical interest.
We now discuss in more detail the parameters that are most
directly measured by the data and how these relate to constraints
on individual parameters of more general interest.
3.1. Acoustic scale

The acoustic oscillations in ` seen in the CMB power spectra
correspond to a sharply-defined acoustic angular scale on the
sky, given by θ∗ ≡ r∗ /DM where r∗ is the comoving sound horizon at recombination quantifying the distance the photon-baryon
perturbations can influence, and DM is the comoving angular diameter distance12 that maps this distance into an angle on the
sky. Planck measures

constraint from T E is of similar precision to that from T T :
although the polarization data are much noisier, the T E and
EE spectra have more distinct acoustic peaks, which helps improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the acoustic scale measurement. Using the combined likelihood we find:
100θ∗ = 1.04109 ± 0.00030

(68 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE),

(9)

a measurement with 0.03 % precision.13
Because of its simple geometrical interpretation, θ∗ is measured very robustly and almost independently of the cosmological model (see Table 5). It is the CMB analogue of the transverse
baryon acoustic oscillation scale rdrag /DM measured from galaxy
surveys, where rdrag is the comoving sound horizon at the end of
the baryonic-drag epoch (see Sect. 5.1). In ΛCDM, the CMB
constraint can be expressed as a tight 0.04 %-precision relation
between rdrag h and Ωm as

The sound horizon rdrag depends primarily on the matter, baryon,
and radiation densities, which for fixed observed CMB temperature today,14 gives a 0.05 % constraint on the combination

Marginalizing out the dependence on the baryon density, the remaining degeneracy between the matter density and Hubble parameters is well approximated by a constraint on the parameter
combination Ωm h3 (Percival et al. 2002). We find a 0.3 % constraint from Planck:
Ωm h3 = 0.09633 ± 0.00029

(68 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE),

(12)

corresponding to an anti-correlation between the matter density
Ωm h2 and the Hubble parameter. This correlation can also be
seen in Fig. 5 as an anti-correlation between the dark-matter
density Ωc h2 and H0 , and a corresponding positive correlation
between Ωc h2 and Ωm .
13
Doppler aberration due to the Earth’s motion means that θ∗ is expected to vary over the sky at the 10−3 level; however, averaged over the
likelihood masks, the expected bias for Planck is below 0.1 σ.
14
We take T 0 = 2.7255K (Fixsen 2009), with the ±0.0006K error
having negligible impact on results.

Fig. 5. Constraints on parameters of the base-ΛCDM model from the separate Planck EE, T E, and T T high-` spectra combined
with low-` polarization (lowE), and, in the case of EE also with BAO (described in Sect. 5.1), compared to the joint result using
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE. Parameters on the bottom axis are our sampled MCMC parameters with flat priors, and parameters on the
left axis are derived parameters (with H0 in km s−1 Mpc−1 ). Contours contain 68 % and 95 % of the probability.
Table 1. Base-ΛCDM cosmological parameters from Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing. Results for the parameter best fits,
marginalized means and 68 % errors from our default analysis using the Plik likelihood are given in the first two numerical
columns. The CamSpec likelihood results give some idea of the remaining modelling uncertainty in the high-` polarization, though
parts of the small shifts are due to slightly different sky areas in polarization. The “Combined” column give the average of the
Plik and CamSpec results, assuming equal weight. The combined errors are from the equal-weighted probabilities, hence including
some uncertainty from the systematic difference between them; however, the differences between the high-` likelihoods are so small
that they have little effect on the 1 σ errors. The errors do not include modelling uncertainties in the lensing and low-` likelihoods
or other modelling errors (such as temperature foregrounds) common to both high-` likelihoods. A total systematic uncertainty of
around 0.5 σ may be more realistic, and values should not be overinterpreted beyond this level. The best-fit values give a representative model that is an excellent fit to the baseline likelihood, though models nearby in the parameter space may have very similar
likelihoods. The first six parameters here are the ones on which we impose flat priors and use as sampling parameters; the remaining
parameters are derived from the first six. Note that Ωm includes the contribution from one neutrino with a mass of 0.06 eV. The
quantity θMC is an approximation to the acoustic scale angle, while θ∗ is the full numerical result.

It is important to emphasize that the values given in Eq. (13) assume the base-ΛCDM cosmology with minimal neutrino mass.
16

These estimates are highly model dependent and this needs to
be borne in mind when comparing with other measurements, for
example the direct measurements of H0 discussed in Sect. 5.4.
The values in Eq. (13) are in very good agreement with the independent constraints of Eq. (6) from Planck CMB lensing+BAO.
Including CMB lensing sharpens the determination of H0 to a

Since the optical depth is reasonably well constrained, degeneracies with other cosmological parameters contribute to the error
in Eq. (19). From the temperature spectrum alone there is a significant degeneracy between As e−2τ and Ωm h2 , since for fixed
θ∗ , larger values of these parameters will increase and decrease
the small-scale power, respectively. This behaviour is mitigated

2015 “lowP” low-` polarization likelihood with the new 2018 “lowE” SimAll likelihood, isolating the impact of the change in the
low-` polarization likelihood (and hence the constraints on τ).
3.4. Scalar spectral index

The scale-dependence of the CMB power spectrum constrains
the slope of the primordial scalar power spectrum, conventionally parameterized by the power-law index ns , where ns = 1 corresponds to a scale-invariant spectrum. The matter and baryon
densities also affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra,
but in a way that differs from a variation in n s , leading to relatively mild degeneracies between these parameters. Assuming
18

that the primordial power spectrum is an exact power law we
find
ns = 0.9649 ± 0.0042

(68 %, Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE
+lensing),

(21)

which is 8 σ away from scale-invariance (ns = 1), confirming the red tilt of the spectrum at high significance in ΛCDM.

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

Section 7.2 and Planck Collaboration X (2020) discuss the implications of this result for models of inflation and include constraints on models with primordial tensor modes and a scaledependent scalar spectral index.
3.5. Matter densities

The matter density can be measured from the CMB spectra using
the scale-dependence of the amplitude, since for fixed θ∗ a larger
matter density reduces the small-scale CMB power. The matter
density also affects the amount of lensing in the CMB spectra
and the amplitude of the CMB-lensing reconstruction spectrum.
The matter density is well constrained to be
(68 %, Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE+lensing).

Ωm h2 = 0.1430 ± 0.0011

(22)

The matter mostly consists of cold dark matter, with density constrained at the percent level:
Ωc h2 = 0.1200 ± 0.0012

(68 %, Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE+lensing).

(23)

Changes in the baryon density affect the spectrum in characteristic ways, modifying the relative heights of the even and odd
acoustic peaks, due to the effect of baryons on the depth of first
and subsequent acoustic (de)compressions. Despite comprising
less than a sixth of the total matter content, the baryon effects
on the power spectra are sufficiently distinctive that the baryondensity parameter is measured at sub-percent level accuracy with
Planck:

• New polarization low-` likelihood. The use of the new HFI
low-` polarization likelihood in place of the 2015 LFI likelihood
is the largest cause of shifts between the 2015 and 2018 parameters. The lowering and tightening of the constraint on τ is responsible for a 1 σ decrease of ln(1010 As ) through the As e−2τ
degeneracy. This in turn decreases the smoothing due to gravitational lensing at high multipoles, which is compensated by an
increase of about 1 σ in ωc . This decreases the amplitude of the
first acoustic peak, so ns shifts to a lower value by about 0.5 σ
to restore power. Further adjustments are then achieved by the
changes of θ∗ and ωb by about 0.5 σ.
• Polarization corrections in the high-` likelihood. As described in detail in Sect. 2.2, the largest changes from 2015 are
caused by corrections applied to the polarization spectra. To isolate the causes of shifts introduced by changes in the high-` likelihood, Fig. 8 compares 2018 results neglecting corrections to
the polarization spectra with results from the 2015 high-` likelihood combined with the 2018 lowE likelihood (so that both
sets of results are based on similar constraints on τ). The shift
towards larger values in ωb by around 1 σ is mainly caused by
the beam-leakage correction in the TE high-` likelihood, which
is also responsible for an increase of approximately 0.5 σ in ns ,
compensating for the shift in ns as a result of the change in τ
since 2015. The beam-leakage correction also changes ωc (by
−0.7 σ) and θMC (+0.7 σ). The other corrections implemented
in 2018 have a smaller impact on the ΛCDM parameters, as described in detail in Planck Collaboration V (2020).
Figure 9 presents the differences between the coadded spectra from 2018 and 2015. This plot shows the stability of the T T
spectra, while also demonstrating that the main differences in polarization between the 2015 and 2018 releases are caused by the
2018 corrections for polarization efficiencies and beam leakage.

(24)

There is a partial degeneracy with ns , which can also affect the
relative heights of the first few peaks. This is most evident in
T E, but is reduced in T T because of the larger range of scales
that are measured by Planck with low noise.
3.6. Changes in the base-ΛCDM parameters between the
2015 and 2018 data releases

Figure 7 compares the parameters of the base-ΛCDM model
measured from the final data release with those reported in
PCP15. To differentiate between changes caused by the new
lowE polarization likelihood, and therefore generated by the
change in the measured optical depth to reionization, we also
show the result of using the 2015 likelihoods in combination
with the 2018 lowE polarization likelihood at low multipoles.
Figure 7 includes the results for both Planck TT+lowE and
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE.16
The main differences in ΛCDM parameters between the
2015 and the 2018 releases are caused by the following effects.
16

The published 2015 parameter constraints and chains had a small
error in the priors for the polarization Galactic foregrounds, which was
subsequently corrected in the published likelihoods. The impact on cosmological parameters was very small. Here we compare with the uncorrected 2015 chains, not the published 2015 likelihood.

As discussed in PCP13 and PCP15, Planck T T spectra are statistically much more powerful than temperature data from current
high-resolution experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT, e.g., Das et al. 2014) and the South Pole
Telescope (SPT, e.g., Story et al. 2013; George et al. 2015). As
a result, the Planck temperature data dominate if they are combined with ACT and SPT data. In PCP15, the high-resolution
temperature data were used only to constrain low-amplitude
components of the foreground model, which are otherwise
weakly constrained by Planck data alone (with very little impact on cosmological parameters). We adopt the same approach
in this paper.
Since the publication of PCP15, Hou et al. (2018) have performed a direct map-based comparison of the SPT temperature
data at 150 GHz with the Planck 143-GHz maps over the same
area of sky (covering 2540 deg2 ), finding no evidence for any
systematic error in either data set after accounting for an overall difference in calibration. Temperature power spectrum comparisons between Planck and SPT are reported in a companion
paper by Aylor et al. (2017). They find cosmological parameters
for base ΛCDM derived from Planck and SPT over the same
patch of sky and multipole range to be in excellent agreement.
In particular, by comparing parameters determined over the multipole range 650–2000 from both experiments, the reduction in
sample variance allows a test that is sensitive to systematic errors that could cause shifts in parameter posteriors comparable to
the widths of the PCP15 posteriors. The parameters determined
over the SPT sky area differ slightly, but not significantly, from
the best-fit ΛCDM parameters reported in PCP15 based on a

likelihood is replaced with 2018 lowE likelihood (2015 Planck TT,TE,EE+2018 lowE). This shows that corrections for polarization
systematics account for most of the small changes between the 2015 and 2018 results that are not caused by the change in optical
depth.

much larger area of sky. Aylor et al. (2017) also find a tendency
for the base-ΛCDM parameters derived from SPT to shift as the
multipole range is increased, but at low statistical significance.
Polarization measurements have become a major focus for
ground-based CMB experiments. High resolution T E and EE
spectra have been measured by the ACT Polarimeter (ACTPol)
and the polarization-sensitive receiver of SPT (SPTpol).
Following two seasons of observations, ACTPol has covered
548 deg2 along the celestial equator at 149 GHz with data and
analysis presented in Naess et al. (2014) and Louis et al. (2017).

The ACTPol spectra span the multipole range 350 < ` < 9000.
SPTpol polarization spectra from 100 deg2 in the southern hemisphere at 150 GHz were first reported in Crites et al. (2015) and
recently extended to 500 deg2 (Henning et al. 2018). The SPTpol
spectra span the multipole range 50 < ` < 8000. In contrast, the
Planck T E and EE power spectra lose statistical power at multipoles >
∼ 1500. The ACTPol and SPTpol spectra are compared
with the Planck T E and EE spectra in Fig. 10. The polarization
spectra measured from these three very different experiments are
in excellent agreement.
For the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the cosmological parameters should have converged close to their true values by multipoles ∼ 2000. Since ACTPol and SPTpol cover a much smaller
sky area than Planck the errors on their T E and EE spectra
are larger than those of Planck at low multipoles (see Fig. 10).
As a consequence, the current ACTPol and SPTpol polarization constraints on the parameters of the base-ΛCDM cosmology
are much weaker than those derived from Planck. The ACTPol
results (Louis et al. 2017) are consistent with the Planck baseΛCDM parameters and showed a small improvement in constraints on extensions to the base cosmology that affect the
damping tail. Similar results were found by SPTpol, though
Henning et al. (2018) noted a >
∼ 2 σ tension with the baseΛCDM model and found a trend for the parameters of the baseΛCDM model to drift away from the Planck solution as the
SPTpol likelihood is extended to higher multipoles. To assess
these results we have performed some tests of the consistency of
the latest Planck results and the SPTpol spectra.
As a reference model for SPTpol we adopt the base-ΛCDM
parameters for the combined T E + EE fit to the SPTpol data
from table 5 of Henning et al. (2018). It is worth noting that the
best-fit SPTpol cosmology is strongly excluded by the Planck
T T spectra and by the Planck T E + EE spectra. We use the
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing base-ΛCDM best-fit cosmology (as plotted in Fig. 10) as a reference model for Planck. For
each model, we ran the public version of the SPTpol likelihood
code,17 sampling the nuisance parameters using the same priors
as in Henning et al. (2018). The best-fit values of χ2 are listed
in Table 3. As in Henning et al. (2018), in assigning significance
levels to these values, we take the number of degrees of freedom to be equal to the number of band powers minus eight,
corresponding to five cosmological parameters (ωb , ωc , θMC , ns ,
As e−2τ ) and three nuisance parameters with flat priors.
As found by Henning et al. (2018), the SPTpol T E spectrum gives nearly identical values of χ2 for both the SPTpol and
Planck cosmologies and so does not differentiate between them;
however, the χ2 values are high, at the 2.3 σ level. The SPTpol
EE spectrum provides weaker constraints on cosmological parameters than the T E spectrum and is clearly better fit by the
SPTpol cosmology. If the SPTpol covariance matrix is accurate,
the combined TE+EE SPTpol data disfavour the Planck ΛCDM
cosmology quite strongly and disfavour any 6-parameter ΛCDM
cosmology. For ΛCDM models, outliers distributed over a wide
range of multipoles contribute to the high χ2 values, notably at
` = 124, 324, 1874, 2449, and 3249 in TE, and ` = 1974 and
6499 in EE.
We can assess consistency of the parameter differences, ∆p,
between the two experiments by computing,

5.1. Baryon acoustic oscillations

As in PCP13 and PCP15 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements from galaxy redshift surveys are used as the primary non-CMB astrophysical data set in this paper. The acoustic scale measured by BAOs, at around 147 Mpc, is much larger
than the scale of virialized structures. This separation of scales
makes BAO measurements insensitive to nonlinear physics, providing a robust geometrical test of cosmology. It is for this reason that BAO measurements are given high weight compared
to other non-CMB data in this and in previous Planck papers.
BAO features in the galaxy power spectrum were first detected
by Cole et al. (2005) and Eisenstein et al. (2005). Since their discovery, BAO measurements have improved in accuracy via a
number of ambitious galaxy surveys. As demonstrated in PCP13
and PCP15 BAO results from galaxy surveys have been consistently in excellent agreement with the best-fit base-ΛCDM cosmology inferred from Planck. More recently, the redshift reach
of BAO measurements has been increased using quasar redshift
surveys and Lyman-α absorption lines detected in quasar spectra.

where C p is the covariance matrix for SPTpol parameters (we
neglect the errors in the Planck parameters, which are much
smaller). Values for χ2p are given in Table 3 together with probabilities to exceed (PTEs) computed from a χ2 distribution with
five degrees of freedom. We find no evidence for any statistically significant inconsistency between the two sets of parameters, even for the combined T E + EE SPTpol likelihood. We also
note that the parameter As e−2τ makes quite a large contribution to
χ2p for the T E + EE and EE spectra, but is sensitive to possible
systematic errors in the SPTpol polarization efficiency calibration (Henning et al. 2018, which, as discussed, is not well understood). Varying the maximum multipole used in the SPTpol likelihood (`max ), we find that the parameters of the SPTpol T E +EE
cosmology converge by `max = 2500; higher multipoles do not
contribute significantly to the SPTpol base-ΛCDM solution.
Henning et al. (2018) reported a trend for the parameters
of the base-ΛCDM cosmology to change as the SPTpol likelihood is extended to higher multipoles, which they suggested
may be an indication of new physics. However, this effect is not
of high statistical significance and cannot be tested by the Planck
spectra, which become less sensitive than the SPTpol spectra
at multipoles >
∼ 1500. The consistency of the base-ΛCDM cosmology at high multipoles in polarization should become clearer
in the near future as more polarization data are accumulated by
ACTPol and SPTpol.

Compared to figure 14 of PCP15, we have replaced the
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ and
CMASS results of Anderson et al. (2014) with the latest BOSS
data release 12 (DR12) results summarized by Alam et al.
(2017). That paper reports “consensus” results on BAOs
(weighting together different BAO analyses of BOSS DR12) reported by Ross et al. (2017), Vargas-Magaña et al. (2018), and
Beutler et al. (2017) in three redshift slices with effective redshifts zeff = 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. These new measurements,
shown by the red triangles in Fig. 11, are in good agreement
with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology.
By using quasars, it has become possible to extend BAO
measurements to redshifts greater than unity. Ata et al. (2018)
have measured the BAO scale DV at an effective redshift of
zeff = 1.52 using a sample of quasars from the extended Baryon
Oscillation Survey (eBOSS). This measurement is shown by the
red circle in Fig. 11 and is also in very good agreement with
Planck. The results of the Ata et al. (2018) analysis also agree
well with other analyses of the eBOSS quasar sample (e.g.,
Gil-Marı́n et al. 2018).
At even higher redshifts BAOs have been measured in the Lyman α spectra of quasars (Delubac et al.
2015;
Font-Ribera et al.
2014;
Bautista et al.
2017;
du Mas des Bourboux et al.
2017;
de Sainte Agathe et al.
2019; Blomqvist et al. 2019). In the first preprint version of
this paper, we compared the Planck results with those from
BAO features measured from the flux-transmission correlations of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 quasars

(Bautista et al. 2017) and with the cross-correlation of the
Ly α forest with SDSS quasars (du Mas des Bourboux et al.
2017). The combined result on DM /rdrag from these analyses was about 2.3 σ lower than expected from the best-fit
Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology. The Bautista et al. (2017)
and du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2017) analyses have been
superseded by equivalent studies of a larger sample of SDSS
DR14 quasars reported in de Sainte Agathe et al. (2019) and
Blomqvist et al. (2019). The combined result for DM /rdrag from
these analyses (as quoted by Blomqvist et al. 2019) is plotted
as the orange hexagon on Fig. 11 and lies within 1.7 σ of the
Planck best-fit model. The errors on these high-redshift BAO
measurements are still quite large in comparison with the galaxy
measurements and so we do not include them in our default
BAO compilation.18
The more recent BAO analyses solve for the positions of the
BAO feature in both the line-of-sight and transverse directions
(the distortion in the transverse direction caused by the background cosmology is sometimes called the Alcock-Paczynski
effect, Alcock & Paczynski 1979), leading to joint constraints
on the angular diameter distance DM (zeff ) and the Hubble parameter H(zeff ). These constraints for the BOSS DR12 analysis are plotted in Fig. 12. Samples from the Planck TT+lowE
and Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing likelihood are shown in
green and red, respectively, demonstrating that BAO and Planck
polarization data with lensing consistently pull parameters in
the same direction (towards slightly lower Ωc h2 ). We find the
same behaviour for Planck when adding polarization and lensing
18

The first preprint version of this paper showed that the inclusion of the Bautista et al. (2017) and du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2017)
Ly α BAO results had a minor impact on the parameters of the baseΛCDM cosmology. The impact of the more recent Ly α results of
de Sainte Agathe et al. (2019) and Blomqvist et al. (2019) will be even
lower, since they are in closer agreement with the Planck best-fit cosmology.

CMB lensing with the galaxy BAO measurements. Evidently,
the Planck base-ΛCDM parameters are in good agreement with
both the isotropized DV BAO measurements plotted in Fig. 11,
and with the anisotropic constraints plotted in Fig. 12.
In this paper, we use the 6dFGS and SDSS-MGS measurements of DV /rdrag (Beutler et al. 2011; Ross et al. 2015) and
the final DR12 anisotropic BAO measurements of Alam et al.
(2017). Since the WiggleZ volume partially overlaps that of the
BOSS-CMASS sample, and the correlations have not been quantified, we do not use the WiggleZ results in this paper. It is clear
from Fig. 11 that the combined BAO likelihood for the lower
redshift points is dominated by the BOSS measurements.

distance-ladder constraints on H0 (see Sect. 5.4), shows a specific example.
5.3. Redshift-space distortions

The clustering of galaxies observed in a redshift survey exhibits
anisotropies induced by peculiar motions (known as redshiftspace distortions, RSDs). Measurement of RSDs can provide
constraints on the growth rate of structure and the amplitude of
the matter power spectrum (e.g., Percival & White 2009). Since
it uses non-relativistic tracers, RSDs are sensitive to the timetime component of the metric perturbation or the Newtonian potential. A comparison of the amplitude inferred from RSDs with
that inferred from lensing (sensitive to the Weyl potential, see
Sect. 7.4). provides a test of General Relativity.
Measurements of RSDs are usually quoted as constraints
on f σ8 , where for models with scale-independent growth f =

dius 8 h−1 Mpc in linear theory.
Measuring f σ8 requires modelling nonlinearities and scaledependent bias and is considerably more complicated than estimating the BAO scale from galaxy surveys. One key problem
is deciding on the precise range of scales that can be used in

an RSD analysis, since there is a need to balance potential systematic errors associated with modelling nonlinearities against
reducing statistical errors by extending to smaller scales. In addition, there is a partial degeneracy between distortions caused by
peculiar motions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Nevertheless,
there have been substantial improvements in modelling RSDs in
the last few years, including extensive tests of systematic errors
using numerical simulations. Different techniques for measuring f σ8 are now consistent to within a few percent (Alam et al.
2017).
Figure 14, showing f σ8 as a function of redshift, is an update of figure 16 from PCP15. The most significant changes from
PCP15 are the new high precision measurements from BOSS
DR12, shown as the red points. These points are the “consensus” BOSS D12 results from Alam et al. (2017), which averages the results from four different ways of analysing the DR12
data (Beutler et al. 2017; Grieb et al. 2017; Sánchez et al. 2017;
Satpathy et al. 2017). These results are in excellent agreement
with the Planck base ΛCDM cosmology (see also Fig. 15) and
provide the tightest constraints to date on the growth rate of fluctuations. We have updated the VIPERS constraints to those of
the second public data release (Pezzotta et al. 2017) and added
a data point from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) redshift survey (Blake et al. 2012). Two new surveys have extended
the reach of RSD measurements (albeit with large errors) to
redshifts greater than unity: the deep FASTSOUND emission
line redshift survey (Okumura et al. 2016); and the BOSS DR14
quasar survey (Zarrouk et al. 2018). We have also added a new
low redshift estimate of f σ8 from Huterer et al. (2017) at an effective redshift of zeff = 0.023, which is based on correlating
deviations from the mean magnitude-redshift relation of SNe in
the Pantheon sample with estimates of the nearby peculiar velocity field determined from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (Springob et al.
2014). As can be seen from Fig. 14, these growth rate measurements are consistent with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology
over the entire redshift range 0.023 < zeff < 1.52.
Since the BOSS-DR12 estimates provide the strongest constraints on RSDs, it is worth comparing these results with Planck
in greater detail. Here we use the “full-shape consensus” results20 on DV , f σ8 , and FAP for each of the three redshift bins
from Alam et al. (2017) and the associated 9 × 9 covariance matrix, where FAP is the Alcock-Paczinski parameter,
FAP (z) = DM (z)

Figure 15 shows the constraints from BOSS-DR12 on f σ8 and
FAP marginalized over DV . Planck base-ΛCDM constraints are
shown by the red and green contours. For each redshift bin,
the Planck best-fit values of f σ8 and FAP lie within the 68 %
contours from BOSS-DR12. Figure 15 highlights the impressive consistency of the base-ΛCDM cosmology from the high
redshifts probed by the CMB to the low redshifts sampled by
BOSS.
5.4. The Hubble constant

Perhaps the most controversial tension between the Planck
ΛCDM model and astrophysical data is the discrepancy with
traditional distance-ladder measurements of the Hubble constant
20
When using RSDs to constraint dark energy in Sect. 7.4, we use the
alternative DM , H, and f σ8 parameterization from Alam et al. (2017)
for consistency with the DR12 BAO-only likelihood that we use elsewhere.

H0 . PCP13 reported a value of H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s−1 Mpc−1
for the base-ΛCDM cosmology, substantially lower that the
distance-ladder estimate of H0 = (73.8 ± 2.4) km s−1 Mpc−1
from the SH0ES21 project (Riess et al. 2011) and other H0 studies (e.g., Freedman et al. 2001, 2012). Since then, additional
data acquired as part of the SH0ES project (Riess et al. 2016;
Riess et al. 2018a, hereafter R18) has exacerbated the tension.
R18 conclude that H0 = (73.48 ± 1.66) km s−1 Mpc−1 , compared to our Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing estimate from
Table 1 of H0 = (67.27 ± 0.60) km s−1 Mpc−1 . Using Gaia
parallaxes Riess et al. (2018b) slightly tightened their measurement to H0 = (73.52 ± 1.62) km s−1 Mpc−1 . Recently
Riess et al. (2019) then used improved measurements of LMC
Cepheids to further tighten22 the constraint to H0 = (74.03 ±
1.42) km s−1 Mpc−1 . Interestingly, the central values of the
SH0ES and Planck estimates have hardly changed since the
appearance of PCP13, but the errors on both estimates have
shrunk so that the discrepancy has grown from around 2.5 σ
in 2013 to 3.5 σ today (4.4 σ using Riess et al. 2019). This
discrepancy has stimulated a number of investigations of possible systematic errors in the either the Planck or SH0ES
data, which have failed to identify any obvious problem
with either analysis (e.g., Spergel et al. 2015; Addison et al.
2016; Planck Collaboration Int. LI 2017; Efstathiou 2014;
Cardona et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017; Follin & Knox 2018). It
has also been argued that the Gaussian likelihood assumption
used in the SH0ES analysis leads to an overestimate of the statistical significance of the discrepancy (Feeney et al. 2018).
Recently, Freedman et al. (2019) have reported a determination of H0 using the tip of the red giant branch as a distance
estimator. This analysis gives H0 = (69.8 ± 1.9) km s−1 Mpc−1 ,
i.e., intermediate between the SH0ES measurement and the
Planck base-ΛCDM value. There has been some controversy
(see Yuan et al. (2019)) concerning the calibration of the tip of
the red giant branch adopted in Freedman et al. (2019), though a
recent reanalysis by Freedman et al. (2020) yields a value of H0
that is almost identical to that reported in Freedman et al. (2019).

26

Measurements of the Hubble constant using strong
gravitational-lensing time delays are also higher than the Planck
base-ΛCDM value. The most recent results, based on six
−1
−1
strongly lensed quasars, give H0 = 73.3+1.7
−1.8 km s Mpc
(Wong et al. 2019), which is about 3.2 σ higher than the
Planck value. A number of other techniques have been used
to infer H0 , including stellar ages (e.g., Jimenez & Loeb
2002; Gómez-Valent & Amendola 2018), distant megamasers
(Reid et al. 2013; Kuo et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2016) and
gravitational-wave standard sirens Abbott et al. (2017). These
measurements span a range of values. Nevertheless, there is a
tendency for local determinations to sit high compared to the
Planck base-ΛCDM value, with the SH0ES Cepheid-based measurement giving the most statistically significant discrepancy.
In this paper, we take the R18 estimate at face value and
include it as a prior in combination with Planck in some of the
parameter tables available on the PLA. The interested reader can
then assess the impact of the R18 measurement on a wide range
of extensions to the base-ΛCDM cosmology.
We already mentioned in Sect. 5.1 that BAO measurements
along the line of sight constrain H(z)rdrag . Planck constrains
rdrag to a precision of 0.2 % for the base-ΛCDM model and so
the BAO measurements can be accurately converted into absolute measurements of H(z). This is illustrated by Fig. 16, which
shows clearly how well the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology fits
the BAO measurements of H(z) over the redshift range 0.3–2.5,
yet fails to match the R18 measurement of H0 at z = 0. The
model is also consistent with the most recent Ly α BAO measurements at z ≈ 2.3.
PCP13 and PCP15 emphasized that this mismatch between
BAO measurements and forward distance-ladder measurements
of H0 is not sensitive to the Planck data at high multipoles. For
example, combining WMAP with BAO measurements leads to
H0 = (68.14 ± 0.73) km s−1 Mpc−1 for the base-ΛCDM cosmology, which is discrepant with the R18 value at the 2.9 σ level.
Heavens et al.
(2014),
Cuesta et al.
(2015),
and
Aubourg et al. (2015) showed that the combination of CMB,
BAO, and SNe data provides a powerful “inverse-distanceladder” approach to constructing a physically calibrated
distance-redshift relation down to very low redshift. For the
base-ΛCDM model, this inverse-distance-ladder approach
can be used to constrain H0 without using any CMB mea-

surements at all, or by only using constraints on the CMB
parameter θMC (see also Bernal et al. 2016; Addison et al.
2018; DES Collaboration 2018a; Lemos et al. 2019). This is
illustrated in Fig. 17, which shows how the constraints on
H0 and Ωm converge to the Planck values as more data are
included. The green contours show the constraints from BAO
and the Pantheon SNe data, together with a BBN constraint
on the baryon density (Ωb h2 = 0.0222 ± 0.0005) based on the
primordial deuterium abundance measurements of Cooke et al.
(2018, see Sect. 7.6). The dashed contours in this figure
show how the green contours shift if the Pantheon SNe data
are replaced by the JLA SNe sample. Adding Planck CMB
lensing (grey contours) constrains Ωm h2 and shifts H0 further
away from the R18 measurement. Using a “conservative”
Planck prior of 100θMC = 1.0409 ± 0.0006 (which is consistent with all of the variants of ΛCDM considered in this
paper to within 1 σ, see Table 5) gives the red contours, with
H0 = (67.9 ± 0.8) km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.305 ± 0.001,
very close to the result using the full Planck likelihood (blue
contours). Evidently, there is a significant problem in matching
the base-ΛCDM model to the R18 results and this tension is not
confined exclusively to the Planck results.
The question then arises of whether there is a plausible extension to the base-ΛCDM model that can resolve the discrepancy. Table 5 summarizes the Planck constraints on H0 for variants of ΛCDM considered in this paper. H0 remains discrepant
with R18 in all of these cases, with the exception of models in

Fig. 17. Inverse-distance-ladder constraints on the Hubble parameter and Ωm in the base-ΛCDM model, compared to the
result from the full Planck CMB power-spectrum data. BAO
data constrain the ratio of the sound horizon at the epoch of
baryon drag and the distances; the sound horizon depends on
the baryon density, which is constrained by the conservative
prior of Ωb h2 = 0.0222 ± 0.0005, based on the measurement of
D/H by Cooke et al. (2018) and standard BBN with modelling
uncertainties. Adding Planck CMB lensing constrains the matter density, or adding a conservative Planck CMB “BAO” measurement (100θMC = 1.0409 ± 0.0006) gives a tight constraint
on H0 , comparable to that from the full CMB data set. Grey
bands show the local distance-ladder measurement of Riess et al.
(2019). Contours contain 68 % and 95 % of the probability.

which we allow the dark energy equation of state to vary. For
models with either a fixed dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w0 , or time-varying equation of state parameterized by w0
and wa (see Sect. 7.4.1 for definitions and further details), Planck
data alone lead to poor constraints on H0 . However, for most
physical dark energy models where pde ≥ −ρde (so w0 > −1),
and the density is only important after recombination, H0 can
only decrease with respect to ΛCDM if the measured CMB
acoustic scale is maintained, making the discrepancy with R18
worse. If we allow for w0 < −1, then adding BAO and SNe
data is critical to obtain a useful constraint (as pointed out by
Aubourg et al. 2015), and we find
H0 = (68.34 ± 0.81) km s−1 Mpc−1 ,

universe does not resolve the discrepancy with R18.
If the difference between base ΛCDM and the R18 measurement of H0 is caused by new physics, then it is unlikely to
be through some change to the late-time distance-redshift relationship. Another possibility is a change in the sound horizon
scale. If we use the R18 measurement of H0 , combined with
27

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

Pantheon supernovae and BAO, the acoustic scale is rdrag =
(136.4 ± 3.5) Mpc. The difficulty is to find a model that can
give this much smaller value of the sound horizon (compared
to rdrag = (147.05 ± 0.3) Mpc from Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE in
ΛCDM), while preserving a good fit to the CMB power spectra and a baryon density consistent with BBN. We discuss some
extensions to ΛCDM in Sect. 7.1 that allow larger H0 values
(e.g., Neff > 3.046); however, these models are not preferred by
the Planck data, and tend to introduce other tensions, such as a
higher value of σ8 .23
The tension between base ΛCDM and the SH0ES H0 measurement is intriguing and emphasizes the need for independent measurements of the distance scale. It will be interesting
in the future to compare the Cepheid distance scale in more detail with other distance indicators, such as the tip of the red giant branch (Freedman et al. 2019), and with completely different
techniques such as gravitational-lensing time delays (Suyu et al.
2013) and gravitational-wave standard sirens (Holz & Hughes
2005; Abbott et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018; Feeney et al. 2019).
5.5. Weak gravitational lensing of galaxies

The distortion of the shapes of distant galaxies by lensing due to
large-scale structure along the line of sight is known as galaxy
lensing or cosmic shear (see e.g., Bartelmann & Schneider 2001,
for a review). It constrains the gravitational potentials at lower
redshift than CMB lensing, with tomographic information and
completely different systematics, so the measurements are complementary. Since the source galaxy shapes and orientations are
in general unknown, the lensing signal is a small effect that can
only be detected statistically. If it can be measured robustly it
is a relatively clean way of measuring the Weyl potential (and
hence, in GR, the total matter fluctuations); however, the bulk
of the statistical power comes from scales where the signal is
significantly nonlinear, complicating the cosmological interpretation. The measurement is also complicated by several other
issues. Intrinsic alignment between the shape of lensed galaxies
and their surrounding potentials means that the galaxy shape correlation functions actually measure a combination of lensing and
intrinsic alignment effects (Hirata & Seljak 2004). Furthermore,
to get a strong statistical detection, a large sample of galaxies
is needed, so most current results use samples that rely mainly
on photometric redshifts; accurate calibration of the photometric
redshifts and modelling of the errors are required in order to use
the observed lensing signal for cosmology.
Cosmic shear measurements are available from several collaborations, including CFHTLenS (Heymans et al.
2012; Erben et al. 2013, which we discussed in PCP15),
DLS (Jee et al. 2016), and more recently the Dark Energy
Survey (DES, DES Collaboration 2018b), Hyper SuprimeCam (HSC, Hikage et al. 2019; Hamana et al. 2020), and
KiDS (Hildebrandt et al. 2017; Köhlinger et al. 2017;
23
To obtain simultaneously higher values of H0 , lower values of σ8 , and consistent values of Ωm it is necessary to
invoke less common extensions of the ΛCDM model, such
as models featuring non-standard interactions in the neutrino,
dark-matter, dark-radiation, and/or dark-energy sector (see e.g.,
Pettorino 2013; Lesgourgues et al. 2016; Planck Collaboration XIV
2016; Archidiacono et al. 2016; Lancaster et al. 2017; Oldengott et al.
2017; Di Valentino et al. 2018; Buen-Abad et al. 2018; Poulin et al.
2019; Kreisch et al. 2019; Agrawal et al. 2019; Lin et al. 2019;
Archidiacono et al. 2019) . Such models are likely to be highly constrained by the Planck, BAO, and supernova data used in this paper and
by future CMB observations and surveys of large-scale structure.

28

Hildebrandt et al. 2020). The CFHTLenS and KiDS results
found a modest tension with the Planck ΛCDM cosmology,
preferring lower values of Ωm or σ8 . A combined analysis of
KiDS with GAMA (van Uitert et al. 2018) galaxy clustering
has found results consistent with Planck, whereas a similar
analysis combining KiDS lensing measurements with spectroscopic data from the 2-degree Field Lensing Survey and
BOSS claims a 2.6 σ discrepancy with Planck (Joudaki et al.
2018). Troxel et al. (2018b) have shown that a more accurate
treatment of the intrinsic galaxy shape noise, multiplicative
shear calibration uncertainty, and angular scale of each bin can
significantly change earlier KiDS results (by about 1 σ), making
them more consistent with Planck. At the time of running our
chains the DES lensing results had been published and included
this improved modelling, while an updated analysis from KiDS
was not yet available; we therefore only consider the DES
results in detail here. Troxel et al. (2018b) reports consistent
results from DES and their new analysis of KiDS, and HSC also
report results consistent with Planck. However, the more recent
KiDS analysis by Hildebrandt et al. (2020) still finds a 2.3 σ
discrepancy with Planck, and Joudaki et al. (2019) claim that a
recalibration of the DES redshifts gives results compatible with
KiDS and a combined 2.5 σ tension with Planck.
The DES collaboration analysed 1321 deg2 of imaging data
from the first year of DES. They analysed the cosmic shear
correlation functions of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins (Troxel et al. 2018a), and also considered the auto(Elvin-Poole et al. 2018) and cross-spectrum (Prat et al. 2018)
of 650 000 lens galaxies in five redshift bins. To be conservative
they restricted their parameter analysis to scales that are only
weakly affected by nonlinear modelling (at the expense of substantially reducing the statistical power of the data). To account
for modelling uncertainties, the cosmic shear analysis marginalizes over 10 nuisance parameters, describing uncertainties in the
photometric redshift distributions, shear calibrations, and intrinsic alignments; the joint analysis adds an additional 10 nuisance
parameters describing the bias and redshift uncertainty of the
lens galaxies.
We use the first-year DES lensing (cosmic shear) likelihood,
data cuts, nuisance parameters, and nuisance parameter priors, as
described by Troxel et al. (2018a); DES Collaboration (2018b);
Krause et al. (2017). We implement the theory model code independently, but use the same physical model and assumptions as
the DES analysis,24 treating the nuisance parameters as fast parameters for sampling in CosmoMC. In this section we adopt the
cosmological parameter priors assumed by Troxel et al. (2018a),
but to be consistent with our other ΛCDM analyses, we assume a single minimal-mass eigenstate rather than marginalizing over the neutrino mass, and use HMcode for the nonlinear
corrections.25 The shear correlation data points and parameter
fits are shown in Fig. 18. Note that intrinsic alignments contribute significantly to the observed shear correlation functions
(as shown by the dotted lines in the figure). This introduces additional modelling uncertainty and a possible source of bias if
24
Except for the modified-gravity models in Sect. 7.4 where we calculate the lensing spectrum directly from the power spectrum of the
Weyl potential (rather than from the matter power spectrum assuming
standard GR).
25
The results are quite sensitive to the choice of cosmological parameter priors, see PL2018 for an analysis using the different priors
assumed by the Planck CMB lensing analysis. Here we assume consistent (DES) priors for DES and CMB lensing results; however, the
Planck power spectrum constraints are much less sensitive to priors and
we use our default priors for those.

Figure 19 shows the constraints in the Ωm –σ8 plane from
DES lensing, compared to the constraints from the CMB power
spectra and CMB lensing. The DES cosmic shear constraint is of
comparable statistical power to CMB lensing, but due to the significantly lower mean source redshift, the degeneracy directions
are different (with DES cosmic shear approximately constraining Ωm σ80.5 and CMB lensing constraining Ωm σ0.25
8 ). The correlation between the DES cosmic shear and CMB lensing results
is relatively small, since the sky area of the CMB reconstruction
is much larger than that for DES, and it is also mostly not at
high signal-to-noise ratio. Neglecting the cross-correlation, we
combine the DES and Planck lensing results to break a large
part of the degeneracy, giving a substantially tighter constraint
than either alone. The lensing results separately, and jointly, are
both consistent with the main Planck power-spectrum results,
although preferring σ8 and Ωm values at the lower end of those
allowed by Planck. The DES joint analysis of lensing and clustering is also marginally consistent, but with posteriors preferring lower values of Ωm (see the next subsection). Overlap of
contours in a marginalized 2D subspace does not of course guarantee consistency in the full parameter space. However, the values of the Hubble parameter in the region of Ωm –σ8 parameter
space consistent with Planck Ωm and σ8 are also consistent with
Planck’s value of H0 . A joint analysis of DES with BAO and a
BBN baryon-density constraint gives values of the Hubble parameter that are very consistent with the Planck power spectrum
analysis (DES Collaboration 2018a).

The power spectrum of tracers of large-scale structure can yield
a biased estimate of the matter power spectrum, which can then
be used as a probe of cosmology. For adiabatic Gaussian initial perturbations the bias is expected to be constant on large
scales where the tracers are out of causal contact with each
other, and nearly constant on scales where nonlinear growth
effects are small. Much more information is available if small
scales can also be used, but this requires detailed modelling of
perturbative biases out to k ≈ 0.3–0.6 Mpc−1 , and fully nonlinear predictions beyond that. Any violation of scale-invariant
bias on super-horizon scales would be a robust test for nonGaussian initial perturbations protected by causality (Dalal et al.
2008). However, using the shape of the biased-tracer power
spectrum on smaller scales to constrain cosmology requires at
least a model of constant bias parameters for each population at
each redshift, and, as precision is increased, or smaller scales
probed, a model for the scale dependence of the bias. Early
galaxy surveys provided cosmology constraints that were competitive with those from CMB power spectrum measurements
(e.g., Percival et al. 2001), but as precision has improved, focus has mainly moved away to using the cleaner BAO and RSD
measurements and, in parallel, developing ways to get the quasilinear theoretical predictions under better control. Most recent
studies of galaxy clustering have focussed on investigating bias
rather than background cosmology, with the notable exception
of WiggleZ (Parkinson et al. 2012).
Here we focus on the first-year DES survey measurement
of galaxy clustering (Elvin-Poole et al. 2018) and the crosscorrelation with galaxy lensing (Prat et al. 2018, “galaxy-galaxy
lensing”). By simultaneously fitting for the clustering, lensing,
and cross-correlation, the bias parameters can be constrained
empirically (DES Collaboration 2018b). Similar analyses using
KiDS lensing data combined with spectroscopic surveys have
been performed by van Uitert et al. (2018) and Joudaki et al.
(2018).
To keep the theoretical model under control (nearly in the
linear regime), DES exclude all correlations on scales where
modelling uncertainties in the nonlinear regime could begin to
bias parameter constraints (at the price of substantially reducing the total statistical power available in the data). Assuming
a constant bias parameter for each of the given source redshift bins, parameter constraints are obtained after marginalizing over the bias, as well as a photometric redshift window
mid-point shift parameter to account for redshift uncertainties.
Together with galaxy lensing parameters, the full joint analysis
has 20 nuisance parameters. Although this is a relatively complex nuisance-parameter model, it clearly does not fully model
all possible sources of error: for example, correlations between
redshift bins may depend on photometric redshift uncertainties
that are not well captured by a single shift in the mean of each
window’s population. However, Troxel et al. (2018a) estimate
that the impact on parameters is below 0.5 σ for all more complex models they considered. The DES theoretical model for the
correlation functions (which we follow) neglects redshift-space
distortions, and assumes that the bias is constant in redshift and k
across each redshift bin; these may be adequate approximations
for current noise levels and data cuts, but will likely need to be
re-examined in the future as statistical errors improve.
Using the full combined clustering and lensing DES likelihood, for a total of 457 data points (DES Collaboration 2018b),
the best-fit ΛCDM model has χ2eff ≈ 500 or 513 with the Planck
best-fit cosmology. Parameter constraints from the galaxy auto-

Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing gives a higher value of S 8 =

in the previous section, the DES lensing results are quite compatible with Planck, although peaking at lower Ωm and σ8 values.
The full joint DES likelihood, however, shrinks the error bars in
the σ8 –Ωm plane so that only 95 % confidence contours overlap
with Planck CMB data, giving a moderate (roughly 2 % PTE)
tension, as shown in Fig. 20. The dotted contour in Fig. 20 shows
the result using the CamSpec Planck likelihood, which gives results slightly more consistent with DES than the default Plik
likelihood. The Planck result is therefore sensitive to the details
of the polarization modelling at the 0.5 σ level, and the tension
cannot be quantified robustly beyond this level.
Combining DES with the baseline Planck likelihood pulls

combined with DES). The shift in parameters is also larger than
would be expected for Gaussian distributions, given the small
change in parameter covariance. The corresponding change in
χ2eff for the DES likelihood is ∆χ2eff ≈ 10, which is high, but less
surprising given the 4–5 contribution expected from the number
of parameters that are much better constrained by Planck. The
summary consistency statistic χ2eff,joint − χ2eff,DES − χ2eff,Planck ≈ 14,
which is high at the roughly 1 % PTE level, given the expected
value of 4, assuming roughly Gaussian statistics (Raveri & Hu
2019).
In summary, the DES combined probes of ΛCDM parameters are in moderate percent-level tension with Planck. Whether
this is a statistical fluctuation, evidence for systematics, or new
physics is currently unclear. In this paper, we follow the philosophy of PCP13 and PCP15 of making minimal use of other astrophysical data in combination with Planck, using BAO as our
primary complementary data set. We therefore do not include
DES results in most of the parameter constraints discussed in
this paper. We do, however, consider the impact of the DES weak
lensing results on dark-energy and modified-gravity constraints
in Sect. 7.4 and on neutrino masses in Sect. 7.5.1. We also include DES for a wider range of models in the Planck parameter
tables available on the PLA.
5.7. Cluster counts

Counts of clusters of galaxies provide an additional way of
constraining the amplitude of the power spectrum at low redshifts (e.g., Pierpaoli et al. 2001; Komatsu & Seljak 2002, and
references therein). Planck clusters, selected via the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signature, were used to explore cosmological parameters in Planck Collaboration XX (2014). This
analysis was revisited using a deeper sample of Planck clusters
in Planck Collaboration XXIV (2016). We have not produced a
new tSZ cluster catalogue in the 2018 Planck data release and
so the results presented in this section are based on the 439
clusters in the MMF3 cluster cosmology sample, as analysed in
Planck Collaboration XXIV (2016). Comparison with the 2018
CMB Planck power spectrum results show differences primarily
from changes to the base-ΛCDM model parameters caused by
the tighter constraints on τ. The impact of the lower value of τ
reported in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016) on the interpretation of cluster counts has been discussed by Salvati et al.
(2018).
We
first
review
the
main
results
from
Planck Collaboration XXIV (2016). There has been increasing
recognition that the calibration of cluster masses is the dominant
uncertainty in using cluster counts to estimate cosmological
parameters. In the analysis of Planck clusters, the cluster tSZ
observable was related to the cluster mass M500 26 using X-ray
scaling relations (Arnaud et al. 2010), calibrated against a subsample of the Planck clusters. The X-ray masses are, however,
derived assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and are expected to
be biased low (e.g., Nagai et al. 2007). This was accounted for
by multiplying the true masses by a so-called “hydrostatic mass
bias” factor of (1 − b). The strongest constraints on this bias
factor come from weak gravitational lensing estimates of cluster
masses. Planck Collaboration XXIV (2016) considered three

Planck clusters calibrated by the Canadian Cluster Comparison
Project (Hoekstra et al. 2015); and 1/(1 − b) = 0.99 ± 0.19
from Planck CMB-lensing mass estimates of the MMF3
cluster sample (Planck Collaboration XXIV 2016). More recently, Sereno et al. (2017) have analysed 35 Planck clusters
with galaxy shear data from the CFHTLenS (Heymans et al.
2012) and RCSLenS (Hildebrandt et al. 2016) surveys, finding
(1 − b) ≈ 0.77 ± 0.11 for all clusters and (1 − b) = 0.68 ± 0.11
for the 15 clusters in the cosmological sample. Additionally,
Penna-Lima et al. (2017) use gravitational lensing measurements from HST images of 21 Planck clusters finding
(1 − b) = 0.73 ± 0.10.
The determination of cosmological parameters such as σ8
and Ωm from Planck cluster counts is strongly dependent on
the prior adopted for the mass bias parameter. In this paper, we use the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing likelihood in
combination with the Planck cluster counts to derive a constraint on (1 − b) (following similar analyses described in
Planck Collaboration XX 2016 and Salvati et al. 2018). This
gives

compared to 0.58 ± 0.04 using the 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP likelihood (Planck Collaboration XX 2016). The roughly 1 σ upward shift in Eq. (34) is mainly caused by the 2018 change
in the τ constraint. The mass bias of Eq. (34) is at the lower
end of the weak-lensing mass estimates, but is about 2 σ
lower that the Planck CMB-lensing mass calibration reported in
Planck Collaboration XX (2016).
Zubeldia & Challinor (2019) have revisited the Planck
CMB-lensing mass calibration, incorporating the CMB-lensing
mass estimates within a likelihood describing the Planck cluster counts, together with a Planck prior on θMC . This study
corrects for significant biases in the analysis reported in
Planck Collaboration XX (2016). Zubeldia & Challinor (2019)
find (1 − b) = 0.71 ± 0.10 and σ8 (Ωm /0.33)0.25 = 0.765 ± 0.035.
These results, based entirely on Planck data, are consistent with
the base-ΛCDM parameters from the Planck power spectra and
with the inferred mass bias of Eq. (34).
Since PCP15 there have been a number of new analyses of cluster counts using other surveys. Two recent studies
(Mantz et al. 2015; de Haan et al. 2016), with very different selection criteria, use weak gravitational lensing mass determinations from the Weighing the Giants programme to calibrate
cluster scaling relations. de Haan et al. (2016) analysed a sample of 377 clusters at z > 0.25 identified with SPT, finding
σ8 (Ωm /0.27)0.3 = 0.797 ± 0.031, while Mantz et al. (2015)
analysed an X-ray-selected sample of clusters from the ROSAT
All-Sky survey, finding σ8 (Ωm /0.3)0.17 = 0.81 ± 0.03. These
measurements can be compared to our baseline ΛCDM constraints (Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing) of σ8 (Ωm /0.27)0.3 =
0.849 ± 0.010 and σ8 (Ωm /0.3)0.17 = 0.817 ± 0.076.
Schellenberger & Reiprich (2017) have analysed a sample of
64 of the brightest X-ray clusters using a prior on the hydrostatic mass bias from Biffi et al. (2016). These authors find Ωm =

0.792 ± 0.054. Each of these numbers is within about 1 σ of
the Planck base-ΛCDM best-fit cosmology reported in this paper. Finally, we mention the analysis of ROSAT-observed X-ray
clusters carried out by Böhringer et al. (2014, 2017). These authors choose a central value for the hydrostatic mass bias of
(1 − b) = 0.9, although they allow for small variations in the
slope (7 %) and normalization (14 %) of the X-ray luminositymass relation; they find constraints the σ8 –Ωm plane in tension
with Planck at about 2.5 σ.
In summary, accurate calibrations of cluster masses are essential if cluster counts are to be used as cosmological probes.
Given the uncertainties in these calibrations, we do not use cluster counts in our main parameter grid. Consistency of cluster
counts with the best-fit Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology requires
hydrostatic mass biases (Eq. 34) that are at the lower end, but
within about 1 σ of bias factors estimated from weak-lensing
cluster masses. The combined Planck CMB-lensing and clustercount analysis reported by Zubeldia & Challinor (2019) is in
good agreement with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology. At
this time, there is no compelling evidence for a discrepancy between Planck-, SPT-, or X-ray-selected cluster counts and the
base-ΛCDM model.

6. Internal consistency of ΛCDM model parameters
In this section we briefly discuss a couple of curious features
of the Planck data that lead to moderate tensions in parameter
consistency tests. We first discuss how parameters vary between
high and low multipoles, and the relevant features in the power
spectra that may be responsible for these shifts. We then discuss
the related issue of how the full multipole range appears to prefer
more lensing than predicted by ΛCDM fits. We end this section
with a discussion of systematic uncertainties.
6.1. Consistency of high and low multipoles

The Planck CMB temperature power spectrum shows a conspicuous dip over the multipole range 20 <
∼ 30 compared
∼ ` <
to ΛCDM fits, as can be seen in Fig. 1. This feature was first
observed by WMAP (Bennett et al. 2003), and was discussed
in detail in PCP13. Since it is detected consistently by both
WMAP and Planck at multiple frequencies, it cannot plausibly be explained by an instrumental systematic or foreground.
The large-scale Planck temperature map is signal dominated, so
the dip feature is almost identical in this final release. PCP13
also noted an approximately 2.7 σ mismatch between the bestfit ΛCDM cosmology and the amplitude of the measured temperature power spectrum at ` ≤ 30. However, with the tighter
optical depth constraints used in this paper and improvements
in the high multipole likelihoods we find no strong evidence for
an amplitude mismatch. The Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing
best-fit ΛCDM model provides a good overall fit to the temperature multipoles at ` < 30 (χ2eff ≈ 23 for 28 data points), and
because of the skewed χ2 -like distribution of the CMB spectrum
estimators, it is expected that typically more than half of the data
points are below the theoretical model values (see Fig. 1). The
statistical significance of the dip feature is hard to quantify, since
it was identified a posteriori, but PPL15 suggest a significance
of about 2.8 % after maximizing over extremal ` ranges found in
simulations. This could be an indication of new physics at large
scales, for example associated with a sharp feature in the inflationary potential (as considered by Peiris et al. 2003, and many
32

subsequent researchers). Alternatively, it could just be a statistical fluctuation, which is our baseline assumption. However,
since the dip is a relatively unusual fluctuation and it is near one
end of the multipole range, it tends to pull cosmological parameters more than would be expected in typical realizations of a
ΛCDM cosmology. This needs to be borne in mind in assessing
parameter shifts between low and high multipoles.
WMAP measured the CMB temperature fluctuations up to
` ≈ 800 (Bennett et al. 2013). The higher-resolution data from
Planck substantially increases the multipole range of the temperature power spectrum out to ` ≈ 2500. Cosmological parameters
are therefore expected to shift (usually towards the truth) from
the mean posterior values measured by WMAP, together with a
reduction in the error bars. This is what is seen, with the Planck
values of H0 and ns decreasing, and Ωm and Ωm h2 increasing,
along with substantially smaller errors. However as noted in
PCP13 the magnitudes of the shifts appear to be slightly larger
than might be expected statistically, assuming the base-ΛCDM
cosmology. This stimulated additional work on the consistency
of the Planck power spectra reported in PPL15 and to further investigations of the consistency of cosmological parameters measured from high and low multipoles from Planck (Addison et al.
2016; Planck Collaboration Int. LI 2017). As noted in the introduction, there is a very good agreement between Planck and
WMAP temperature maps on the scales observed by WMAP
(Planck Collaboration I 2016; Huang et al. 2018), but an inconsistency with high multipoles could indicate either new physics
beyond ΛCDM, or the presence of some unidentified systematics associated with the Planck data and/or the foreground model.
Planck Collaboration Int. LI (2017) find that although some cosmological parameters differ by more than 2 σ between ` < 800
and ` > 800, accounting for the multi-dimensional parameter
space including correlations between parameters, the shifts are
at the 10 % level and hence not especially unusual. Nonetheless,
parameter shifts, particularly in the fluctuation amplitude and
Hubble parameter (which are directly relevant for the ΛCDMcomparison with external data, as discussed in Sect. 5) are worth
a brief re-examination using the additional information provided
by the Planck polarization spectra.
Constraints on cosmological parameters from power spectra
at high multipoles require a foreground model. Previous studies have shown that results are not very sensitive to the specific assumptions that are made within the broad context of
slowly varying foreground spectra expected on physical grounds
(Addison et al. 2016; Planck Collaboration Int. LI 2017). In this
section, we use the plik lite Planck likelihood, described
in detail in PPL18, which has the standard Plik foreground
and nuisance parameters marginalized out without further assumptions on the cosmology.28 For standard model extensions
plik lite accurately reproduces results from the full Plik
likelihood. It allows us to explore the high-` likelihood accounting for foreground uncertainties, but with the foregrounds constrained in a sensible way from their spectra over the full multipole range. We consider the multipole ranges ` ≤ 801 and
` ≥ 802 (corresponding to the boundary of one of the plik lite
bins), so that the low-multipole range is roughly comparable to
WMAP and the two ranges have similar statistical power on
28

We do not attempt to quantify likelihood modelling differences in
this section, but a CamSpec-based likelihood gives slightly less tension
between high and low multipoles (especially with polarization), associated with the weaker preference for AL > 1, as discussed in more detail
in Sect. 6.2.

most parameters. Results splitting at ` ≈ 1000 are similar, but
with larger errors in the high multipole range.
Figure 21 shows a comparison of the high and low multipole
ranges, both for temperature (lower triangle, as previously discussed by Addison et al. 2016 and Planck Collaboration Int. LI
2017), and new results for the combined temperaturepolarization likelihood (upper triangle). Part of the difference between the low- and high-multipole ranges is caused by the largescale temperature dip discussed above; if we exclude multipoles
` < 30 (unfilled grey contours), the contours from ` ≤ 801 shift
towards the area of consistency with the high multipoles. This
could indicate that the low-multipole results have been pulled
unusually far from the truth by the large-scale power spectrum
dip; if so, the WMAP temperature results would also have been
pulled at a similar (but not identical) level. The region of overlap
of the high- and low-multipole parameter constraints is consistent with constraints from the nearly-independent combination
of EE polarization and lensing with a conservative Ωb h2 prior
(green contours). This is consistent with a statistical fluctuation
pulling the low and high multipoles in opposite directions, so
that their intersection is closer to the truth if ΛCDM is correct.
Figure 22 shows marginalized individual parameter constraints, and also a comparison with the results from the polarization likelihoods at high and low multipoles. The ` ≥ 802 temperature results pull parameters to a region of higher matter density
and fluctuation amplitude (and to lower ns and H0 ) than the lower
multipole range, and predict a CMB lensing amplitude parameter σ8 Ω0.25
= 0.649 ± 0.018. This is in tension with the CMB

lensing-reconstruction measurement of σ8 Ω0.25
m = 0.589 ± 0.020
at 2.2 σ (as pointed out by Addison et al. 2016 with 2015 data;
also see the closely-related discussion in the next subsection).
As shown in Fig. 22, combining the ` ≥ 802 CMB likelihood
with the lensing reconstruction, all parameter results move back
towards the same region of parameter space as combining with
` ≤ 801, consistent with the high-` temperature result having
fluctuated high along the main degeneracy direction. As dis34

cussed in Sects. 2.3 and 3.3, the combined CMB power spectrum results over the full multipole range are consistent with the
lensing likelihood.
It is also interesting to compare to parameter constraints
from the CMB power spectrum multipoles ` ≤ 801 combined
with the lensing and BAO, which gives

These results are entirely independent of the cosmological parameter fit to the ` ≥ 801 power spectra, but agree well at the
1 σ level with the full joint results in Table 1 (which have similar errors on these parameters). An equivalent result could be
obtained using WMAP data after replacing their low-` polarization with the Planck HFI measurement (i.e., lowE).
For the temperature likelihoods, the difference between the
low- and high-multipole constraints remains evident, with Ωm h2
differing at the 2.8 σ level. Adding polarization, the results from
the multipole ranges are more consistent, as shown in Fig. 22,
though the difference in Ωm h2 is still unusual at the roughly
2 σ level. However, the shifts in the different parameters are all
highly correlated, due to partial parameter degeneracies, so the
significance of any individual large shift is lower after accounting for the number of parameters (Planck Collaboration Int. LI
2017). The internal tensions between multipole ranges appear to
be consistent with moderate statistical fluctuations, related to the
low-` dip at large scales and correlated with the lensing amplitude on small scales. The large-scale feature is well determined
by both WMAP and Planck and very robustly measured. The
internal consistency of the Planck power spectra between different frequencies and detectors (PPL15, PPL18) argues against
systematics driving large parameter shifts at high multipoles.
Equation (35) also demonstrates that any effect from the high-

multipole spectra alone cannot be pulling our baseline parameters by more than about 1 σ. In the next subsection we describe
in more detail the apparent preference for a higher lensing amplitude, and the features in the observed spectrum that could be
responsible for it.
6.2. Lensing smoothing and AL

In addition to the direct measurement of CMB lensing described
in Sect. 2.3 and PL2018, lensing can be seen in the Planck CMB
power spectra via the lensing-induced smoothing of the acoustic peaks and transfer of power to the damping tail. This effect
is modelled in our main parameter analysis, and can be calculated accurately from the unlensed CMB power spectra and the
CMB lensing potential power spectrum in each model (Seljak
1996; Lewis & Challinor 2006). Interesting consistency checks
include testing if the amplitude of the smoothing effect in the
CMB power matches expectation and whether the amplitude of
the smoothing is consistent with that measured by the lensing
reconstruction. To do this, the theoretical prediction for the lensing spectrum in each model is often scaled by an “AL ” consistency parameter, where the theoretical expectation is that AL = 1
(Calabrese et al. 2008).
As shown in Fig. 3, the Planck lensing-reconstruction power
spectrum is consistent with the amplitude expected for ΛCDM
models that fit the CMB spectra, so the Planck lensing measurement is compatible with AL = 1. However, the distributions of
AL inferred from the CMB power spectra alone are shown in
Fig. 23 for various different data combinations, and these indicate a preference for AL > 1, with
AL = 1.243 ± 0.096 (68 %, Planck TT+lowE),
(36a)
AL = 1.180 ± 0.065 (68 %, Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE), (36b)
assuming a ΛCDM+AL model. The TE polarization data alone
slightly prefer AL < 1, with the EE data slightly preferring

Fig. 24. Base-ΛCDM model (AL = 1) T T power spectrum residuals smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of width σ` = 40. The
black line shows the smoothed difference between the coadded
data points and the theoretical model for the Planck TT+lowE
best-fit model, while coloured lines show the residuals for samples over the allowed parameter space coloured by the value
of Ωm h2 . Grey bands show the 1, 2, and 3 σ diagonal range
expected for the smoothed residuals in the best-fit model. The
red dashed line shows 10 % of the lensing-smoothing difference
predicted in the best-fit model, displaying the oscillatory signal expected if there were more lensing of the acoustic peaks.
The data residuals are not particularly anomalous, but the residuals have a similar pattern to the lensing smoothing difference
over the approximate range ` = 1100–2000, giving a preference
for around 10 % more lensing at fixed cosmological parameters.
Allowed models with lower Ωm h2 (and hence higher H0 ) predict less lensing and give a larger oscillatory residual, preferring
relatively more lensing smoothing than models with high matter
density. The black dashed line shows the smoothed residual for
the Planck TT+lowE best fit to ΛCDM+AL (with AL = 1.19).
AL > 1; however, both are consistent with AL = 1 within 2 σ.
The joint combined likelihood shifts the value preferred by the
TT data downwards towards AL = 1, but the error also shrinks,
increasing the significance of AL > 1 to 2.8 σ (99.8 % of parameter samples have AL > 0, so the one-tailed limit is almost
exactly 3 σ). Moreover, combining with the lensing likelihood
further pulls the constraint towards AL = 1, which is then consistent with the data to within 2 σ; we see that the preference for
AL > 1 is driven by the CMB power spectra alone.
The preference for high AL is not just a volume effect in
the full parameter space (see PCP13 for discussion of such effects in multi-parameter fitting), with the best fit improved by
∆χ2eff = −8.7 when adding AL for TT+lowE and ∆χ2eff = −9.7 for
TT,TE,EE+lowE. The bulk of the ∆χ2eff comes from the high-`
likelihood (mostly in the range 600 < ` < 1500); however, the
low-` temperature commander likelihood fit is also improved if
AL is free, with ∆χ2eff = −2.3 and ∆χ2eff = −1.3 for the TT+lowE
and TT,TE,EE+lowE, respectively, due to the lower amplitude
of the AL fit on large scales. The change in fit to the low-` polarization is not very significant (∆χ2eff = −0.2 and ∆χ2eff = −0.4).
The determination of AL from the high-` polarization data
and the TT,TE,EE+lowE joint combination depends on the cali35

The dashed contours show equivalent results for Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE when using the CamSpec likelihood, which gives results
with AL nearer unity and with slightly larger errors. The second row of subplots show, on the left axis, the predicted lensing deflection
angle variance (from lensing multipoles 2 ≤ L ≤ 2000), which is a measure of the amount of actual lensing: the TT,TE,EE+lowE
likelihood prefers about 10 % more actual lensing power (associated with lensing smoothing), but in the (unphysical) varying-AL
case this can be achieved using cosmological parameters that predict less lensing than in ΛCDM but substantially larger AL , giving
a preference for AL ≈ 1.2.
bration of the polarization channels, and is affected by different
ways of modelling the polarization efficiencies, as discussed in
Sect. 2.2. The results from the CamSpec likelihood (which uses
spectrum-based rather than map-based calibrations for T E and
EE) are somewhat shifted with respect to the Plik likelihood,
as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 23, and have larger errors,
giving
AL = 1.246+0.092
(37a)
−0.100 (68 %, TT+lowE [CamSpec]),
AL = 1.149 ± 0.072 (68 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE [CamSpec]). (37b)
Using CamSpec there is still a clear preference for AL > 1, but
the joint result with polarization is now only just over 2 σ above
AL = 1. The differences between these Plik and CamSpec results arise from differences in the methodologies used to create
the likelihoods. Although both likelihoods clearly show a preference for AL > 1, this cannot be claimed to be a robust detection
at much over 2 σ (see also Efstathiou & Gratton 2019).
The preference for AL > 1 within the ΛCDM model is a
curious feature of the Planck CMB power spectrum data, and
has already been discussed extensively in PCP13, PCP15, and
Planck Collaboration Int. LI (2017), although it is now slightly
more significant. In temperature, over half of the small (approximately 0.02) upward shift in AL compared to 2015 is explained
by the lower optical depth from the 2018 low-` likelihood: lower
τ implies lower As to match the high-` CMB fluctuation amplitude, and hence larger AL to yield a lensing amplitude and hence
amount of smoothing at the same level as 2015. In polarization
about 40 % of the shift in AL is explained by changes in τ, with
changes in the maps, modelling for beam leakage, and polarization efficiencies explaining the rest.
The high-` temperature likelihood preference for more lensing smoothing than allowed by ΛCDM can be seen by eye in the
smoothed data residuals plotted in Fig. 24; over almost all the
allowed ΛCDM parameter space there is an oscillatory residual
in the range 1100 <
∼`<
∼ 2000 that matches the shape of the lensing smoothing29 (although in other multipole ranges it does not
29
Although the oscillatory pattern looks most similar to lensing at
high multipoles, an increase in the foreground model amplitude can

36

match at all). The residual is not obviously anomalous, with the
TT ΛCDM best fit improving by ∆χ2 ≈ 4 if a best-fit oscillatory
residual (with AL ≈ 1.1) is added to the best-fit ΛCDM theory
model. The stronger preference for AL > 1 when AL varies arises
because degeneracies between AL , cosmological parameters, and
foregrounds improves the fit at both high and lower multipoles,
as shown by the black dashed line in Fig. 24. In ΛCDM the lensing amplitude can be increased by increasing Ωm h2 ; however, the
model then becomes a bad fit because of the poorer agreement
at ` < 1000). Varying AL allows a high AL to remove the oscillatory residual at high multipoles that appears in ΛCDM with
lower Ωm h2 , giving best fits with lower Ωm h2 and higher H0 (by
1.5–2.0 σ, depending on the exact combination of data used) that
are not favoured in the physical ΛCDM model. Lower values of
Ωm h2 give higher values of ns , lowering the theory prediction
on large scales, so high AL models are also slightly preferred by
the dip in the ` < 30 Planck temperature data. The parameter
degeneracies are illustrated in Fig. 25.
The AL results appear to be robust to changes in foreground
modelling in the baseline likelihood, with the CamSpec 545 GHz
cleaned likelihood (see Appendix A) giving very similar results.
However, the dip in the residuals at 1420 <
∼ 1480, part of the
∼`<
oscillatory feature that looks like additional lensing, nearly coincides with an approximately 3 σ discrepancy (for the best-fit
foreground cosmology model) between the 143-GHz and 217GHz power spectra at 1450 <
∼`<
∼ 1510, with the 217-GHz spectrum pulling the coadded spectrum low compared to 143 GHz
by an amount comparable to the coadded residual (at ` = 1480
the 217-GHz spectrum is D` ≈ 7 µK2 lower than 143 GHz with
smoothing σ` = 40; see PPL18). This may be an indication that
the preference for AL at high multipoles is partly due to unknown
systematics or foregrounds. However, tightly cutting the ` range
decrease the oscillation amplitude in the theory contribution to the
spectrum, and hence appear as an oscillatory difference. For example
∆ns ≈ −0.02, combined with an implausibly large change in the foreground model, gives a difference in the predicted spectrum with an oscillatory component that has similar amplitude to ∆AL ≈ 0.1; see the
related discussion in Planck Collaboration Int. LI (2017).

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

that contributes to the 3 σ frequency difference does not in itself shift AL to substantially lower values (though cutting all of
1420 <
∼` <
∼ 1480 does), and the significance of the oscillatory
feature in the ΛCDM CMB residual is in any case not very high.
If it is largely a statistical fluctuation, it would be expected to
vary with changes in sky area; that is somewhat the case, with
around 80 % sky area giving a substantially less oscillatory residual to the same best-fit ΛCDM model at ` <
∼ 1600, but still
favouring high AL . Different power spectrum analyses have also
shown the preference for AL (Spergel et al. 2015; Couchot et al.
2017), though with varying significance, which could indicate
that our roughly 3 σ significance is partly an issue of analysis
choices, e.g., the sky areas included and foreground priors chosen.
The dashed line in Fig. 3 shows the lensing power spectrum in the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE best-fit ΛCDM+AL model,
which is clearly inconsistent with the lensing reconstruction,
since it lies above almost all of the measured data points.
Because the amplitude of the lensing smoothing effect can be
calculated from the lensing potential power spectrum alone,
which we can also empirically measure, it is impossible to increase the lensing smoothing of the CMB peaks without also
increasing the measured lensing reconstruction amplitude. This
remains true if the lensing power spectrum is allowed to vary
in shape (Motloch & Hu 2018). The actual lensing smoothing
effect can also partly be removed by delensing, as shown by
Larsen et al. (2016) and Carron et al. (2017). In PL2018 we update these delensing analyses, and show (using the internal lensing reconstruction, a Planck CIB map as a tracer of the lensing potential, and a combined estimate) that the amount of peak
sharpening observed after delensing is consistent with theoretical expectations (e.g., for the T T spectrum, we measure a reduction in lensing smoothing of 0.411 ± 0.028, compared to the
expected value of 0.375 when using a combination of CIB and
Planck lensing reconstruction).
Although the residuals shown in Fig. 24 between the data
and the ΛCDM best fit temperature spectrum show what looks
like an oscillatory lensing residual at high `, the fit itself is determined by the entire range of multipoles (and the low-` polarization than constrains τ). The preference for AL > 1 could
therefore be attributed to other scales when considering the CMB
spectra alone. For example, after removing ` < 30 in both temperature and polarization, AL from T T is consistent with unity
to within 1 σ. However, in this case the ΛCDM lensing amplitudes are still large, giving a value of Ωm σ0.25
8 , in 2 σ tension
with the lensing reconstruction. This is another reflection of the
tension noted in Sect. 6.1 between the lensing reconstruction
and the lensing amplitude predicted using temperature multipoles ` >
∼ 800: the two tensions are therefore not independent
and largely driven by the same features of the ΛCDM fit to the
temperature and low-` polarization data.
If AL > 1 is not just a statistical fluctuation, but comes from
new physics changing the theoretical predictions, it could be
something that mimics the smoothing effect in the CMB peaks.
The lensing smoothing effect comes from averaging over the
sky a spectrum that is locally varying (due to magnification and
shear locally changing the scale and shape of the CMB peaks).
Conceptually, the temperature lensing reconstruction works by
looking for this spatial variation in scale and shear of the local
power. Any non-lensing isotropic change in the amplitude of the
small-scale peaks and troughs, either from new physics or random fluctuations, would therefore only have a small effect on the
lensing reconstruction, which is sensitive to scale and shape, not
amplitude.

One locally anisotropic physical effect that has been considered as a possible explanation is the presence of largescale compensated isocurvature modes, discussed in detail
in Planck Collaboration X (2020). Because the large-scale
isocurvature modes locally vary the baryon-to-photon ratio,
they can partially mimic the lensing smoothing effect by spatially varying the acoustic scale (Muñoz et al. 2016; Valiviita
2017). However, because they have a similar local effect to
lensing, they also affect the large-scale lensing reconstruction (Smith et al. 2017). Combining with the Planck 2018 lensing reconstruction, which now extends down to L = 8, as shown
in Planck Collaboration X (2020) this model therefore does not
offer a significant improvement in overall fit (∆χ2eff = −3.3 with
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing).
If the AL > 1 preference is simply a statistical excursion
(perhaps the most likely explanation), this indicates that there
are random features in the spectrum that are pulling some parameters unusually far from expected values.30 There are several
theoretical models that can fit the CMB power spectra and also
predict larger lensing amplitudes. These include ΛCDM models with spatial curvature, for which we find ΩK < 0 at over
3 σ (Sect. 7.3) from the CMB power spectra, and some dark energy and modified gravity models (Sect. 7.4). For extensions to
base-ΛCDM, parameters that decrease the lensing amplitude are
more constrained by the Planck power spectra than might otherwise be expected; for example, higher neutrino masses lower the
predicted lensing power compared to base ΛCDM, leading to
surprisingly tight constraints (Sect. 7.5.1). Adding the lensingreconstruction information significantly reduces the parameter
space of larger lensing amplitudes and partially mitigates these
effects. However, the statistical power of the Planck power spectra is sufficiently high that the joint constraints prefer lensing
amplitudes in the higher range allowed by the lensing data.
Even within ΛCDM, the fact that the data prefer more lensing leads to a preference for higher fluctuation amplitudes, hence
the high-` data yield higher As and higher τ than we infer in
combination with large-scale E-mode polarization (Sect. 2.2.3)
or lensing reconstruction. Since these preferences are degenerate
with Ωm h2 , ns , and H0 (see PCP13, PCP15), these parameters are
also pulled (Ωm h2 higher, ns and H0 lower). Our baseline best-fit
results include both the “lowE” data and the lensing reconstruction, each of which restrict the range of allowed variation, so the
remaining pulls should be modest; however, it should not perhaps be too much of a surprise if the central values of the parameters inferred from Planck turn out to be slightly more shifted
than typical with respect to the ultimate truth if the base-ΛCDM
model is correct.

7. Extensions to the base-ΛCDM model
7.1. Grid of extended models

We have studied a range of extension to the base ΛCDM model.
A full grid of results from standard parameter extensions is available online through the PLA.31 Figure 26 and Table 4 summarize
30
It is not trivial to assess how unlikely a fluctuation in a consistency parameter like this is given the number of different cosmological
and consistency test parameters we might have looked at. We are only
discussing AL in detail here because it comes out high; other consistency parameters, for example the relative amplitude of ISW, Doppler,
and Sachs-Wolfe contributions to the temperature spectrum, come out
perfectly consistent with expectations.

the constraints on 1-parameter extensions to the base-ΛCDM
model. As in 2013 and 2015 we find no strong evidence in favour
of any of these extensions, using either the Planck data alone or
Planck combined with BAO. We also find that constraints on the
base-ΛCDM parameters are remarkably robust to a variety of
possible extensions to the ΛCDM model, as shown in Table 5:
many of these parameters are constrained to high precision in a
nearly model-independent way.
We now discuss some specific extensions in more detail.
7.2. Early Universe

CMB observations probe the state of the universe at the earliest
time that is directly observable with the electromagnetic spectrum. The physics of the anisotropies is well understood, and
can be predicted accurately with linear theory given a set of initial conditions. Planck observations can therefore be used to give
powerful constraints on the initial conditions, i.e., the perturbations present at the start of the hot big bang. We discuss in turn
constraints on the scalar and tensor perturbations, allowing for
deviations from a purely power-law scalar spectrum, and discuss the interpretation within the context of the most popular
inflationary models.
7.2.1. Primordial scalar power spectrum

The Planck data are consistent with purely adiabatic primordial
scalar curvature perturbations, with no evidence for isocurvature modes (see Planck Collaboration X 2020), as predicted by
the simplest single-field inflation models. The primordial power
spectrum is then just a function of scale. In this section, we characterize the scalar fluctuation spectrum in terms of a spectral index ns and its first two derivatives with respect to ln k (the “running” and “running of the running” of the spectral index):
!n(k)
k
PR (k) = As
,
(38a)
k0
n(k) = ns − 1 + (1/2)(dns /d ln k) ln(k/k0 )
+(1/6)(d2 ns /d ln k2 )(ln(k/k0 ))2 .
(38b)
In the absence of any running of the spectral index, our constraint on ns for the base-ΛCDM model (Eq. 21) shows an 8 σ tilt
away from scale invariance. Adding BAO tightens the constraint
to nearly 9 σ:
ns = 0.9665 ± 0.0038

(68 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing
+BAO).

(39)

The need for a red-tilted scalar spectrum is quite robust to extensions to base ΛCDM, as summarized in Table 5. In all cases, we
find ns < 1 at ≥ 3 σ.
Adding running of the spectral index, dns /d ln k, as a single
additional parameter to base ΛCDM, we find


(40b)

where ns is defined by default at k = 0.05 Mpc−1 and ns,0.002
is the corresponding tilt at k = 0.002 Mpc−1 . The slight preference for negative running is driven by the mild tension between the CMB temperature power spectrum at high and low
multipoles discussed in Sect. 6.1, with negative running allowing higher large-scale tilt, giving less power on large scales (see
Fig. 27 and the extensive discussions in PCP13 and PCP15). The
measurements of the tilt and running around the pivot scale of
k ≃ 0.05 Mpc−1 are robust to allowing even more freedom for
the spectrum to vary with scale. For example, allowing for running of the running we find

d2 ns /d ln k2 = 0.009 ± 0.012, 

+lowE+lensing



ns = 0.9647 ± 0.0043,  +BAO.
Here the slight preference for negative running has almost disappeared, and there is instead a slight preference for lower largescale power by having positive running of the running, leaving
a near power-law solution on small scales. There is no evidence
for any significant deviation from a power law on small scales.
This is consistent with the simplest slow-roll inflation models
where the running (and higher derivatives of the spectral index)
are higher order in slow-roll (so that dns /d ln k = O(|ns − 1|2 ),
d2 ns /d ln k2 = O(|ns − 1|3 )) and all deviations from a constant
spectral index can be neglected at Planck sensitivity.
An analysis of more general parameterizations of the
primordial power spectrum are presented in section 6 of
Planck Collaboration X (2020), including various specific physically motivated models, as well as general parametric reconstructions. Models with many more free parameters can provide better fits to the data, but none are favoured; in all cases
the small-scale spectrum is found to be consistent with a power
−1
law over the range 0.008 Mpc−1 <
∼ k <
∼ 0.1 Mpc , with lowsignificance hints of larger-scale features corresponding to the
dip in the low-` temperature power spectrum. The introduction
of the additional degrees of freedom in the initial power spectrum had no significant impact on the determination of the main
cosmological parameters for the parameterizations considered.
7.2.2. Tensor modes

Primordial gravitational waves32 , or tensor modes, source a distinctive curl-like (“B-mode”) pattern in the CMB polarization
and add additional power to the large-scale temperature power
spectrum (Kamionkowski et al. 1997; Seljak & Zaldarriaga
1997). Planck’s B-mode measurement is noise and systematics
limited and provides a relative weak constraint on the tensorto-scalar ratio r0.002 < 0.41 (95 % CL, Planck Collaboration V
2020). As with the 2013 and 2015 releases, the strongest constraint on tensor modes from the Planck data alone comes from
the T T spectrum at ` <
∼ 100.
The precision of the Planck temperature constraint remains
limited by cosmic variance from the scalar component and is
model dependent. The tightest and least model-dependent constraints on the tensor amplitude come from the Ade et al. (2018,
BK15) analysis of the BICEP2/Keck field, in combination with
Planck and WMAP maps to remove polarized Galactic dust
emission. The BK15 observations measure the B-mode polarization power spectrum in nine bins at ` <
∼ 300, with the tensor amplitude information coming mainly from scales ` ≃ 100,
32
The polarization anisotropies generated by gravitational waves was
discussed first by Polnarev (1985).

where the B-mode spectrum from scattering at recombination is
expected to peak. The Planck CMB power spectrum measurements use a much larger sky area, and are useful to convert this
measurement into a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r at a
given scale with little additional cosmic variance error. To relate
the tensor measurement to constraints on specific inflation models (which usually predict a region in the ns –r plane), combining
with the Planck data is also essential, although model dependent.
Figure 28 shows the constraints in the ns –r plane, with r
added as a single additional parameter to the base model and
plotted at pivot scale 0.002 Mpc−1 . We assume the tensor-mode

spectrum is close to scale invariant, with spectral index given
by the inflation consistency relation to second order in slow-roll
parameters. Planck alone gives

and adding BAO data tightens (slightly) the ns constraint. Using
the Planck temperature likelihoods we find
r0.002 < 0.055

(95 %, TT+lowE+lensing+BK15+BAO), (43)

with ns = 0.9661 ± 0.0040 at 1 σ, or adding polarization
r0.002 < 0.058

(95 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing
+BK15+BAO),

(44)

with ns = 0.9668 ± 0.0037 at 1 σ. However, the small change
when adding polarization is not stable to the choice of polarization likelihood; when using the CamSpec TT,TE,EE+lowE likelihood in place of Plik, we find the weaker constraint r0.002 <
0.065 for the same data combination as that used in Eq. (44).
All the combined ns –r contours exclude convex potentials
at about the 95 % confidence (marginally less if we use the
CamSpec likelihood, see Fig. 28), which substantially restricts
the range of allowed inflation models and disfavours all simple
integer power law potentials. More generally, since r depends
40

on the slope of the potential, the smallness of the empirical upper limit on r implies that the inflationary potential must have
been nearly flat when modes exited the horizon. The measured
ns must then be determined largely by the second derivative of
the potential, suggesting a hierarchy in the magnitudes of the
slow-roll parameters, favouring hilltop-like potentials. For a detailed discussion of the implications for specific inflation models
see Planck Collaboration X (2020).
If we allow running of the spectral index in addition to tensor modes, the constraint on r0.002 weakens if we use only the
Planck likelihood; a negative running allows ns at large scales to
shift to higher values, lowering the large-scale scalar amplitude,
and hence allowing a larger tensor contribution. Inclusion of the
BK15 likelihood significantly reduces the extent of this degeneracy by constraining the tensor amplitude more directly, giving

The combination of Planck and BK15 robustly constrain the
tensor ratio to be small, with r0.002 <
∼ 0.06. The implications
for inflation are slightly more model dependent as a result of
degeneracies between ns and additional parameters in extended
ΛCDM models. However, as shown in Table 5, the extensions
of ΛCDM that we consider in this paper cannot substantially
shift the value of the spectral index when the tensor amplitude is
small, so the overall conclusions are unlikely to change substantially in extended models.
7.3. Spatial curvature

The base-ΛCDM model assumes that the spatial hypersurfaces
are flat, such as would be predicted (to within measurable precision) by the simplest inflationary models. This is a prediction
that can be tested to high accuracy by the combination of CMB
and BAO data (the CMB alone suffers from a geometric degeneracy, which is weakly broken with the addition of CMB lensing).
This is illustrated in Fig. 29.

negative values of ΩK are discussed at length in PCP15 and
Sect. 6.2. They are essentially the same as those that lead to the
preference for AL > 1, although slightly exacerbated in the case
of curvature, since the low multipoles also fit the low-` temperature likelihood slightly better if ΩK < 0. As with the AL > 1
preference, the joint Planck polarization result is not robust at
the approximately 0.5 σ level to modelling of the polarization
likelihoods, with the CamSpec TT,TE,EE+lowE likelihood giving ΩK = −0.037+0.019
−0.014 .
Closed models predict substantially higher lensing amplitudes than in ΛCDM, so combining with the lensing reconstruction (which is consistent with a flat model) pulls parameters back
into consistency with a spatially flat universe to well within 2 σ:

7.4. Dark energy and modified gravity

The late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe (Riess et al.
1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) is still considered one of the most
mysterious aspects of the standard cosmology. In the base
ΛCDM model the acceleration is driven by a cosmological constant, added into the Einstein equations of General Relativity
(GR, Einstein 1917). Although ΛCDM fits the data well, Λ is
a phenomenological parameter without an underlying theoretical basis to explain its value (though see Weinberg 1987). In
addition, the empirically required value of Λ marks our epoch
as a special time in the evolution of the Universe. Attempts have
therefore been made to find a dynamical mechanism that leads
to cosmic acceleration, with evolving background energy densities close to ΛCDM. Such dynamics is usually associated with a
fluid (a scalar field) which we refer to as “dark energy” (DE), or
with modifications of GR, which we refer to as “modified gravity” (MG).
A detailed analysis of the impact of Planck data on
dark energy and modified gravity was presented in a dedicated paper that accompanied the 2015 Planck release,
42

(Planck Collaboration XIV 2016, hereafter PDE15). We refer
the reader to this paper for a review of different cosmological
models, and for constraints from Planck on its own and in combination with galaxy weak lensing (WL) and redshift-space distortions (RSDs). In PDE15 it was shown that although the baseΛCDM model fits Planck data, there were some tensions (at levels as high as 3 σ) when Planck was combined with RSD and
WL data, even when conservative cuts were applied to exclude
nonlinear scales. However, the addition of Planck lensing data
was found to reduce these tensions. Updated constraints on a
few specific models, using more recent WL data, are presented
in DES Collaboration (2018b).
In this paper, we follow a similar methodology to PDE15,
distinguishing between models that directly affect only the
background (and impact perturbations predominantly through
changes in the expansion rate) and those that directly affect perturbations. However, we restrict the analysis to a smaller range
of models here. As in the rest of this paper, we show results
for the baseline Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing data set and
for combinations with other relevant data sets. Such external
data are particularly useful for constraining DE and MG models because the largest deviations from ΛCDM are usually at
late times, which are not well constrained by the CMB powerspectra and CMB lensing. However, CMB lensing provides important information that mitigates the preference for AL > 1 seen
in the Planck temperature power spectra (Sect. 6.2), so we explicitly comment on the impact of CMB lensing wherever relevant. We recall here that the lensing likelihood assumes a fiducial ΛCDM model, but linear corrections to the fiducial mode
are accounted for self-consistently. PL2018 explicitly tested that
this procedure is unbiased, even when the lensing spectrum differs from the fiducial spectrum by as much as 20 % (which is
much larger than differences allowed by the CMB lensing data).
We consider the following external data sets:
– SNe + BAO (see Sects. 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4 for discussions
of the data sets and comments on why we do not combine
Planck data with direct measurements of H0 );
– RSDs (as described in Sect. 5.3), where we specifically
use BOSS-DR12 data from Alam et al. (2017), adopting the
f σ8 –H–DM parameterization;
– WL data from DES (as described in Sect. 5.5), except that
here we use the Weyl potential to obtain theoretical predictions for the lensing correlation functions, rather than assuming the matter-sourced Poisson equation to relate the lensing
potential power spectrum to the matter power spectrum.
We calculate all results both fixing and varying the neutrino
mass. Neutrino masses are known to be degenerate with DE and
MG and should be varied consistently when testing such models (as discussed in Dirian 2017); fixing the neutrino mass to
the minimal value of 0.06 eV (as for our baseline ΛCDM results) gives tighter constraints than allowing the neutrino mass
to vary and partly shifts results towards ΛCDM. These shifts
are usually small, often negligible, and always less than 1 σ for
marginalized results. We model the small-scale nonlinear power
spectrum using HMcode (Mead et al. 2015, 2016) as in the main
parameter grid of extensions to base-ΛCDM, neglecting any differences arising from modified gravity. In using the DES weaklensing correlation functions, we exclude scales where nonlinear modelling uncertainties are important, but since the modified gravity models introduce an additional level of uncertainty,
we also marginalize over the feedback amplitude B with a flat
prior, 2 ≤ B ≤ 4. This parameter is used by HMcode to introduce
an additional uncertainty in the nonlinear correction due to the

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

with the speed of light c set to 1. The functions Φ(τ, x) and
Ψ(τ, x) are the gauge-invariant gravitational potentials, which
are very nearly equal at late times in ΛCDM. For the background parameterization we use the standard CAMB code, while
for the perturbation parameterization we use the publicly available code MGCAMB33 (Zhao et al. 2009; Hojjati et al. 2011) integrated into the latest version of CosmoMC. For the effective field
theory (EFT) models of Sect. 7.4.3 we use EFTCAMB34 (Hu et al.
2014; Raveri et al. 2014).
7.4.1. Background parameterization: w0 , wa

If the DE is a generic dynamical fluid, its equation of state parameter w ≡ p/ρ will in general be a function of time. Here p
and ρ are the spatially-averaged (background) DE pressure and
density.
To test a time-varying equation of state we adopt the functional form
w(a) = w0 + (1 − a)wa ,

(49)

where w0 and wa are assumed to be constants. In ΛCDM, w0 =
−1 and wa = 0. We use the parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF)
model of Fang et al. (2008) to explore expansion histories where
w crosses −1. The PPF equations are modelled on the perturbations of quintessence dark energy, i.e., they correspond to a
fluid with vanishing anisotropic stress and a rest-frame speed
of sound approximately equal to the speed of light. Because of
the high sound speed, dark-energy density perturbations are suppressed inside the horizon and are irrelevant compared to the
matter perturbations, except on the very largest scales. While
this is the standard procedure adopted in the literature, we should
emphasize that a single minimally-coupled canonical scalar field
(quintessence) cannot cross w = −1 (Vikman 2005). Such a
crossing could happen in models with two scalar fields (one of
which would have to be a phantom field with the opposite sign
of the kinetic term); in such models the perturbations remain
close to the quintessence case (see e.g., Kunz & Sapone 2006).
Alternatively, the phantom “barrier” can be crossed with a sound
speed that vanishes in the phantom domain (Creminelli et al.
2009) or in models with additional terms in the action, such as
in kinetic-gravity-braiding (Deffayet et al. 2010), or with nonminimal couplings (Amendola 2000; Pettorino & Baccigalupi
2008). These and other modified gravity models, typically also
change the behaviour of the perturbations.

modelling of the baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum
at small scales, modifying the halo mass-concentration relation

residual sensitivity of our results on the nonlinear modelling in
modified gravity theories; marginalizing over B reduces the constraining power coming from nonlinear scales, where the correction recipe used by HMcode may not correctly reproduce the
perturbation evolution for all the models included in our parameterization.

Fig. 30. Marginalized posterior distributions of the (w0 , wa )
parameters for various data combinations. The tightest constraints come from the combination Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE
+lensing+SNe+BAO and are compatible with ΛCDM. Using
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing alone is considerably less constraining and allows for an area in parameter space that corresponds to large values of the Hubble constant (as already
discussed in Planck Collaboration XIII 2016 and PDE15). The
dashed lines indicate the point corresponding to the ΛCDM
model. The parametric equation of state given by Eq. (49) stays
out of the phantom regime (i.e., has w ≥ −1) at all times only in
the (upper-right) unshaded region.

Marginalized contours of the posterior distributions for w0
and wa are shown in Fig. 30. Note that CMB lensing has only
a small effect on the constraints from Planck alone (see the parameter grid tables in the PLA). Using Planck data alone, a wide
volume of dynamical dark-energy parameter space is allowed,
with contours cut off by our priors (−3 < w0 < 1, −5 < wa < 5,
and 0.4 < h < 1; note that Fig. 30 does not show the complete prior range). However, most of the allowed region of parameter space corresponds to phantom models with very high
values of H0 (as discussed in PDE15); such models are inconsistent with the late-time evolution constrained by SNe and BAO
data. This is illustrated in Fig. 30 which also shows constraints if
we add BAO/RSD+WL and BAO+SNe to the Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE+lensing likelihood. The addition of external data sets
narrows the constraints towards the ΛCDM values of w0 = −1,
wa = 0. The tightest constraints are found for the data combination Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO+SNe; the difference in χ2 between the best-fit DE and ΛCDM models for this
data combination is only ∆χ2 = −1.4 (which is not significant
given the two additional parameters). Numerical constraints for
these data combinations, as well as χ2 differences, are presented
in Table 6. It is also apparent that for the simple w0 , wa parameterization of evolving DE, Planck combined with external data
sets does not allow significantly lower values of S 8 or higher
values of H0 compared to the base-ΛCDM cosmology.
Fixing the evolution parameter wa = 0, we obtain the tight
constraint

background level (i.e., w = −1 at all times), but instead turn
our attention to constraining the behaviour of the dark sector
perturbations.
7.4.2. Perturbation parameterization: µ, η

In the types of DE or MG models considered here, changes to
observables only arise via the impact on the geometry of the
Universe. At the level of perturbations, it is then sufficient to
model the impact on the gravitational potentials Φ and Ψ, or,
equivalently, on two independent combinations of these potentials (e.g., Zhang et al. 2007; Amendola et al. 2008). Following
PDE15 we consider two phenomenological functions, µ and η,
defined as follows.
1. µ(a, k): a modification of the Poisson equation for Ψ,


k2 Ψ = −µ(a, k) 4πGa2 ρ∆ + 3(ρ + P)σ ,

At late times, σ from standard particles is negligible and we
find

These definitions are phenomenological, in the sense that
they are not derived from a theoretical action. However, they

are able to capture a generic deviation of the perturbation evolution from ΛCDM that does not need to correspond to a known
model. This approach is complementary to constraints on actionbased models, which are the topic of the next subsection. When
η = µ = 1 we recover GR at all times, including when there are
non-zero contribution from photons and neutrinos to the density perturbation or anisotropic stress. In the parameterization
adopted here (described further below), the MG contribution to
η is only relevant at late times, when the anisotropic stress from
relativistic particles is negligible.
In this section we fix the background evolution to that of
ΛCDM (w = −1 at all times), so that any significant deviation of
µ or η from unity would indicate a deviation from ΛCDM. We
also consider constraints on the derived quantity Σ, defined as

k2 [Φ + Ψ] = −Σ(a, k)4πGa2 2ρ∆ − 3(ρ + P)σ .

AL

Fig. 32. Degeneracy between AL and Σ0 − 1, computed as a derived parameter in our (µ, η) parameterization. The horizontal
dashed line includes ΛCDM (but is also marginalized over one
of the two degrees of freedom in the µ–η space). The vertical
dashed line shows AL = 1. The filled contours use the Planck
TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing likelihood, alone and in combination
with WL+BAO/RSD data. The unfilled contours show the constraints from Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE. Note that AL only affects
CMB lensing of the Planck power spectra by definition, as discussed in Sect. 6.2.

Since Σ measures deviations of the lensing potential from the
GR prediction, it is better constrained by WL data than µ and η
separately.
For simplicity we only allow µ and η to vary with time (as in
PDE15). Scale dependence increases the number of degeneracies in parameter space and may require, for example, higherorder statistics in WL observables (Peel et al. 2018) to break
the degeneracies. We use the late-time DE parameterization of
PDE15 and Casas et al. (2017), where the time evolution of all
quantities is assumed to be proportional to the relative darkenergy density:
µ(z) = 1 + E11 ΩDE (z);

(56a)

η(z) = 1 + E21 ΩDE (z).

(56b)

This defines the constants E11 and E21 . We report results in terms
of µ0 ≡ µ(z = 0) and η0 ≡ η(z = 0), which are determined
from E11 and E21 , given the dark-energy density parameter today. This parameterization is motivated by the assumption that
the impact of dark energy depends on its density and therefore
allows for more deviation of µ and η from ΛCDM at late times.
The alternative early-time parameterization included in PDE15
led to similar results and is not discussed here for brevity. Our
choice of parameterization, of course, limits the nature of possible deviations from ΛCDM; however, the choices of Eqs. (56a)
and (56b) allow us to compare our results directly with those of
PDE15.
Figure 31 shows the marginalized constraints on µ0 and η0
from different combinations of data, and also compares with the
results from PDE15. Marginalized mean values and errors for
cosmological parameters are presented in Table 7. This table
also lists results for hd2 i1/2 , the root-mean-square CMB lensing deflection angle, and the parameter combination Σ0 S 8 that
is well-constrained by the DES WL data. These quantities allow

the reader to assess the impact of lensing data on the parameter
constraints. The µ parameter affects the growth of structure, so,
for example, higher µ gives larger values of σ8 . The CMB only
constrains MG via the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (on large
scales, where there is large cosmic variance) and CMB lensing.
Lensing observations do not constrain the fluctuation amplitude
directly, but the amplitude scaled by Σ (as defined in Eq. 55).
The degeneracy direction shown in Fig. 31 corresponds to approximately constant lensing amplitude, with higher µ0 requiring lower Σ0 and hence lower η0 . The thickness of the degeneracy contour and its location depends on the constraint on lensing.
With Planck data alone, or Planck+SNe+BAO, the lensing amplitude is pulled to high values by the preference for more lensing discussed in Sect. 6.2, so the contours are slightly shifted
with respect to ΛCDM. The inclusion of WL35 data shrinks the
contour, and reduces the offset with respect to ΛCDM; DES WL
data disfavour higher lensing amplitudes than predicted by the
Planck ΛCDM cosmology. DES also measures lensing at much
lower redshift than CMB lensing, so it is a more powerful probe
of MG models where changes to GR only appear at late times
(as we have assumed).
The BAO/RSD data constrain µ0 directly, since redshift
distortions are a probe of structure growth. The lower panel
of Fig. 31 shows constraints with BAO/RSD alone, and also
demonstrates that removing the CMB lensing reconstruction
data shifts the contour further from ΛCDM; this is consistent
with the pull away from ΛCDM being driven by the preference
for more lensing in the high-` CMB power spectra.
We can further demonstrate the effect of CMB lensing
by varying the consistency parameter AL within MG models.
Figure 32 shows the degeneracy between AL and Σ0 − 1, which
is computed as a derived parameter in our (µ, η) parameterization. Here AL affects lensing of the CMB power spectra only,
while Σ0 encodes modifications to the lensing amplitude caused
by modifications of gravity. The contours show that MG models
(Σ0 , 1) are preferred by the Planck power spectra (although
not strongly) if AL = 1. The preference for higher Σ0 values
is reduced by allowing larger AL ; the preference for MG that
we find is therefore largely another reflection of the preference
for AL > 1 discussed in Sect. 6.2. Adding Planck CMB lensing measurements shifts the contours back into consistency with
ΛCDM (blue contours). Adding BAO/RSD + WL tightens the
constrains (red contours) which remain consistent with ΛCDM.
Using the CamSpec likelihood gives slightly less preference for
high AL , and the results for Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing
shift by about 0.2 σ towards better consistency with ΛCDM.
7.4.3. Effective field theory description of dark energy

To investigate action-based models that can give interesting values of µ and η, we limit ourselves to a sub-class of effective
field theories (EFTs, Cheung et al. 2008; Creminelli et al. 2009;
Gubitosi et al. 2013). The EFTs we consider contain models
with a single scalar field and at most second-order equations of
motion, a restriction that is in general necessary to avoid the socalled Ostrogradski instability. In addition, EFTs typically assume a universal coupling to gravity; models with non-universal
35
Tests during the writing of this paper revealed a bug in MGCAMB that
was also present in 2015. This bug reduced the constraining power of
WL data for the (µ, η) parameterization (which in 2015 was suppressed
by the very conservative excision of nonlinear scales). The CMB and
BAO/RSD constraints and other cosmological models were not affected
by this bug.

multiple scalar fields, additional vector (Hellings & Nordtvedt

(Belgacem et al. 2018) do not fall into this class and are not considered here. Nevertheless EFTs provide a general set of models
for which we can, in principle, compute all quantities of interest,
including µ and η (which will span a restricted part of the µ–η

As described in section 5.2.1 of PDE15, the degrees of freedom in actions of this class of models can
be reduced to the expansion rate H and five additional
functions of time (Gleyzes et al. 2013; Bellini & Sawicki
2014) {αM , αK , αB , αT , αH }. However, measurements of the
speed of gravitational waves (Abbott et al. 2017) imply
that αT (z = 0) ≃ 0, which reduces the space of acceptable models (Lombriser & Taylor 2016; McManus et al. 2016;
Creminelli & Vernizzi 2017; Ezquiaga & Zumalacarregui 2017;

Apart from models where gravitational wave propagation is
not modified at all, which would necessarily limit us to η = 1
(Saltas et al. 2014), only conformally (non-minimally) coupled
models36 with αB = −αM (and αH = 0) naturally lead to αT = 0.
For these reasons we focus on this latter class of models (and
for simplicity we assume αT (z) ≃ 0 at all times), and in addition choose the kinetic terms of the scalar (set by αK ) to keep
the scalar sound speed equal to the speed of light (current observational data are not able to constrain the sound speed significantly, see e.g., the k-essence model constraints in PDE15). We
finally end up with a non-minimally coupled k-essence model
36

Recently the EFT action has been extended to include degenerate higher-order theories (DHOST, Zumalacárregui & Garcı́a-Bellido
2014; Gleyzes et al. 2015; Ben Achour et al. 2016), which feature an
additional parameter called β1 (Langlois et al. 2017). DHOST models
can also give αT ≈ 0, but αH and β1 are constrained to be small from astrophysical tests of gravity (Crisostomi & Koyama 2018; Langlois et al.
2018; Dima & Vernizzi 2018; Saltas et al. 2018).

Another class of models that predicts values of (µ, η) in the topleft quadrant of Fig. 31 are the non-local models, specifically the
RR model of Dirian et al. (2016); these models are not discussed
here.
Overall, the EFT sub-class of non-minimally coupled kessence models considered here is not preferred by current data.
Without using CMB and galaxy WL lensing, Planck gives a
moderate preference for models that predict more lensing compared to ΛCDM (as found in our investigation of the (µ, η)
parameterization). However, combining Planck with CMB and
DES WL lensing measurements disfavours high lensing amplitudes and pulls the parameters towards ΛCDM.

the same as in ΛCDM, as in our analysis of the µ–η parameterization described in the previous section. The main difference
relative to PDE15 is that we now allow for αM < 0, which corresponds to a Planck mass decreasing with time.
As in PDE15 we adopt the parameterization α M = α M0 a β ,
where α M0 is the value of α M today and where β > 0 determines
how quickly the absolute value of α M decreases at high redshift.

the parameter constraints for these data combinations and lists
the changes in χ2 of the best fits relative to base ΛCDM. As
was the case for the (µ, η) parameterization, DES WL measurements pull the contours towards ΛCDM. If we determine µ0 and

for a specific scale choice, we find that the parameters lie in the

7.4.4. General remarks

Planck alone provides relatively weak constraints on dark energy
and modified gravity, but Planck does constrain other cosmological parameters extremely well. By combining Planck with external data we then obtain tight constraints on these models. We
find no strong evidence for deviations from ΛCDM, either at the
background level or when allowing for changes to the perturbations. At the background level, ΛCDM is close to the best fit.
In the simple µ–η and EFT parameterizations of perturbationlevel deviations from GR, we do find better fits to the Planck
TT,TE,EE+lowE data compared to ΛCDM, but this is largely
associated with the preference in the CMB power spectra for
higher lensing amplitudes (as discussed in Sect. 6.2), rather than
a distinctive preference for modified gravity. Adding weak lensing data disfavours the large lensing amplitudes and our results
are consistent with ΛCDM to within 1 σ. Since neutrino masses
are in general degenerate with DE and MG parameters, it is also
worth testing the impact of varying neutrino masses versus fixing them to our base-ΛCDM value of mν = 0.06 eV. We find
similar trends, with slightly larger posteriors when varying the
neutrino mass.
7.5. Neutrinos and extra relativistic species
7.5.1. Neutrino masses

The Planck base-ΛCDM model
P assumes a normal mass hierarchy with the minimal mass mν = 0.06 eV allowed by neutrino
flavour oscillation experiments. However, current observations
are consistent with many neutrino mass models, and there are
no compelling theoretical reasons to strongly prefer any one of
them. Since the
P masses are already known to be non-zero, allowing for larger mν is one of the most well-motivated extensions
of the base model. The normal hierarchy, in which the lowest two
mass
eigenstates have the smallest mass splitting, can give any
P
mν >
∼ 0.06 eV; an inverted hierarchy, in which the two most
massive
eigenstates have the smallest
P
P mass separation, requires
mν >
0.1
eV.
A
constraint
that
mν < 0.1 eV would therefore
∼
rule out the inverted hierarchy. For a review of neutrino physics
and the impact on cosmology see e.g., Lesgourgues et al. (2013).
As in PCP13 and PCP15, we quote constraints assuming
three species of neutrino with degenerate mass, a Fermi-Dirac
distribution, and zero chemical potential. At Planck sensitivity
the small mass splittings can be neglected to good accuracy (see
e.g., Lesgourgues & Pastor 2006). Neutrinos that become nonrelativistic around recombination produce distinctive signals in
the CMB power spectra, which Planck and other experiments
have already ruled out. If the neutrino mass is low enough that
they became non-relativistic after recombination (mν  1 eV),
the main effect on the CMB power spectra is a change in the
47

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

angular diameter distance that is degenerate with decreasing H0 .
The Planck data then mainly constrain lower masses via the lensing power spectrum and the impact of lensing on the CMB power
spectra. Since the CMB power spectra prefer slightly more lensing than in the base-ΛCDM model, and neutrino mass can only
suppress the power, we obtain somewhat stronger constraints
than might be expected in typical realizations of a minimal-mass
neutrino model.
In PCP15 no preference for higher neutrino masses was
found, but a tail to high neutrino masses was still allowed, with
relatively high primordial amplitudes As combining with high
neutrino mass to give acceptable lensing power. The tighter
2018 constraint on the optical depth from polarization at low
multipoles restricts the primordial As to be smaller, to match
the same observed high-` power (C` ∝ As e−2τ ); this reduces
the parameter space with larger neutrino masses, giving tighter
constraints on the mass. With only temperature information at
high `, the 95 % CL upper bound moved from 0.72 eV (PCP15
TT+lowP) to 0.59 eV (using the SimLow polarization likelihood
of Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI 2016, at low `). This now further tightens to
X

mν < 0.54 eV

(95 %, Planck TT+lowE).

(58a)

masses the constraint is largely determined by the lensing effect.
The differences between Plik and CamSpec are much smaller
if we add CMB lensing, since the lensing measurements restrict
the lensing amplitude to values closer to those expected in base
ΛCDM.
The combination of the acoustic scale measured by the CMB
(θMC ) and BAO data is sufficient to
P largely determine the background geometry in the ΛCDM+ mν model, since the lowerredshift BAO data break the geometric degeneracy. Combining
BAO data with the CMB lensing reconstruction power spectrum
(with priors on Ωb h2 and ns , following PL2015), the neutrino
mass can also be constrained to be
X

mν < 0.60 eV

(95 %, Planck lensing+BAO+θMC ).

(61)

This number is consistent with the tighter constraints using the
CMB power spectra, and almost independent of lensing effects
in the CMB spectra; it would hold even if the AL tension discussed in Sect. 6.2 were interpreted as a sign of unknown residual systematics. Since the constraint from the CMB power spectra is strongly limited by the geometrical degeneracy, adding
BAO data to the Planck likelihood significantly tightens the neutrino mass constraints. Without CMB lensing we find

Adding high-` polarization further restricts residual parameter
degeneracies, and the limit improves to

(58b)

Although the high-` TT spectrum prefers more lensing than in
base ΛCDM, the lensing reconstruction is very consistent with
expected amplitudes. In PCP15, the 2015 lensing likelihood
weakened joint neutrino mass constraints because it preferred
substantially less lensing than the temperature power spectrum.
The 2018 lensing construction gives a slightly (1–2 %) higher
lensing power spectrum amplitude than in 2015, which, combined with the decrease in the range of higher lensing amplitudes allowed by the new TT+lowE likelihood, means that the
constraints are more consistent. Adding lensing therefore now
slightly tightens the constraints to

mν < 0.44 eV

(95 %, TT+lowE+lensing),

(59a)

X

mν < 0.24 eV

(95 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing).

(59b)

The joint constraints using polarization are however sensitive to the details of the high-` polarization likelihoods, with the
CamSpec likelihood giving significantly weaker constraints with
polarization:

mν < 0.38 eV

(95 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE [CamSpec]) (60a)

X

mν < 0.27 eV

(95 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE
+lensing [CamSpec]).

(60b)

As discussed in Sect. 6.2, the CamSpec TT,TE,EE+lowE likelihood shows a weaker preference for higher lensing amplitude
AL than the default Plik likelihood, and this propagates directly
into a weaker constraint on the neutrino mass, since for small

mν < 0.12 eV

(95 %, Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE

These combined constraints are almost immune to high-` polarization modelling uncertainties,
with the CamSpec likelihood
P
giving the 95 % limit mν < 0.13 eV for Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE+lensing+BAO.
Adding the Pantheon SNe data marginally tightens the bound
P
to
mν < 0.11 eV (95 %, Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing
+BAO+Pantheon). In contrast the full DES 1-year data prefer a
slightly lower σ8 value than the Planck ΛCDM best fit, so DES
slightly
favours higher neutrino masses, relaxing the bound to
P
mν < 0.14 eV (95 %, Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO
+DES).
Increasing the neutrino mass leads to lower values of H0 , and
hence aggravates the tension with the distance-ladder determination of Riess et al. (2018a, see Fig. 34). Adding the Riess et al.
(2018a) H0 measurement to Planck will therefore give even
tighter neutrino mass constraints (see the parameter tables in the
PLA), but such constraints should be interpreted cautiously until
the Hubble tension is better understood.
The remarkably tight constraints using CMB and BAO data
are comparable with the latest bounds from combining with
Ly α forest data (Palanque-Delabrouille et al. 2015; Yèche et al.
2017). Although Ly α is a more direct probe of the neutrino mass

Additional radiation does not need to be fully thermalized, in
which case ∆Neff must be computed on a model-by-model basis.
We follow a phenomenological approach in which we treat Neff
as a free parameter. We allow Neff < 3.046 for completeness,
corresponding to standard neutrinos having a lower temperature
than expected, even though such models are less well motivated
theoretically.
The 2018 Planck data are still entirely consistent with Neff ≈
3.046, with the new low-` polarization constraint lowering the
2015 central value slightly and with a corresponding 10 % reduction in the error bar, giving

The standard cosmological model has Neff ≈ 3.046,
slightly larger than 3 since the three standard model neutrinos were not completely decoupled at electron-positron
annihilation (Gnedin & Gnedin 1998; Mangano et al. 2005;
de Salas & Pastor 2016).
We can treat any additional massless particles produced well
before recombination (that neither interact nor decay) as simply
an additional contribution to Neff . Any species that was initially
in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model particles produces a ∆Neff (≡ Neff − 3.046) that depends only on the number

electroweak phase transition, g∗ remains somewhat below the naive 106.75 value expected for all the particles in the Standard
Model, giving interesting targets for ∆Neff that may be detectable in future CMB experiments (see e.g. Baumann et al. 2018).
data changes in the same way, the low-redshift BAO geometry
helps to partially break the degeneracies. Despite improvements
in both BAO data and Planck polarization measurements, the
joint Planck+BAO constraints remain similar to PCP15:

Neff = 2.99+0.34

(95 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing

(67b)

For Neff > 3.046 the Planck data prefer higher values of the
Hubble constant and fluctuation amplitude, σ8 , than for the baseΛCDM model. This is because higher Neff leads to a smaller
sound horizon at recombination and H0 must rise to keep the
acoustic scale, θ∗ = r∗ /DM , fixed at the observed value. Since
the change in the allowed Hubble constant with Neff is associated with a change in the sound horizon, BAO data do not help to
strongly exclude larger values of Neff . Thus varying Neff allows
50

the tension with Riess et al. (2018a, R18) to be somewhat eased,
as illustrated in Fig. 35. However, although the 68 % error from
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO on the Hubble parameter is weakened when allowing varying Neff , it is still discrepant
with R18 at just over 3 σ, giving H0 = (67.3±1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1 .
Interpreting this discrepancy as a moderate statistical fluctuation,
the combined result is

However, as explained in PCP15, this set of parameters requires
an increase in σ8 and a decrease in Ωm , potentially increasing tensions with weak galaxy lensing and (possibly) cluster
count data. Higher values for Neff also start to come into tension with observational constraints on primordial light element
abundances (see Sect. 7.6).

minimal-mass active neutrinos and one additional sterile neutrino with mass parameterized by meff
ν, sterile . The physical mass for
thermally-produced sterile neutrinos, mthermal
sterile , is constant along
the grey lines labelled by the mass in eV; the equivalent result
for sterile neutrinos produced via the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism (Dodelson & Widrow 1994) is shown by the adjacent thinner lines. The dark grey shaded region shows the part of parameter space excluded by our default prior mthermal
sterile < 10 eV, where
the sterile neutrinos would start to behave like dark matter for
CMB constraints.

Restricting ourselves to the more physically motivated
models with ∆Neff > 0, the one-tailed Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE+lensing+BAO constraint is ∆Neff < 0.30 at 95 %. This
rules out light thermal relics that decoupled after the QCD phase
transition (although new species are still allowed if they decoupled at higher temperatures and with g not too large). Figure 36
shows the detailed constraint as a function of decoupling temperature, assuming only light thermal relics and other Standard
Model particles.
7.5.3. Joint constraints on neutrino mass and Neff

There are various theoretical scenarios in which it is possible to
have both sterile neutrinos and neutrino mass. We first consider
the case of massless relics combined with thePthree standard degenerate active neutrinos, varying Neff and mν together. The
parameters are not very correlated, so the mass constraint is similar to that obtained when not also varying Neff . We find:

The bounds Premain very close to the bounds on either Neff
(Eq. 67b) or mν (Eq. 63b) in 7-parameter models, showing that
the data clearly differentiate between the physical effects generated by the addition of these two parameters. Similar results are
found without lensing and BAO data. Although the mass constraint is almost unchanged, varying Neff does allow for larger
Hubble parameters, as shown in Fig. 34. However, as discussed
in PCP15 and the previous section, this does not substantially

help to resolve possible tensions with σ8 measurements from
other astrophysical data.
The second case that we consider is massive sterile neutrinos combined with standard active neutrinos having a
minimal-mass hierarchy, parameterizing the sterile mass by

∆Neff the physical mass can therefore become large, in which
case the particles behave in the same way as cold dark matter.
In our grid of parameter chains we adopt a prior that mthermal
sterile <
10 eV (and necessarily ∆Neff ≥ 0) to exclude parameter space
that is degenerate with a change in the cold dark matter density;
as we show in Fig. 37, detailed constraints will depend on this
choice of prior. Assuming mthermal

The mass constraint in Eq. (70a) actually appears weaker than
in PCP15; this is because the change in optical depth reduces
the high-Neff parameter space, and the remaining lower-Neff parameter space has significant volume associated with models
thermal
having relatively large meff
ν, sterile (close to the msterile prior cut).
Removing this high-physical-mass parameter space by tightening the prior to 2 eV gives the mass constraint in Eq. (70b),
which is substantially tighter than the result quoted in PCP15
without high-` polarization.
One thermalized sterile neutrino with ∆Neff = 1 is excluded
at about 6 σ irrespective of its mass, or at about 7 σ when assuming a mass mDW
sterile ≈ 1 eV. This is especially interesting in
the context of the controversial evidence for light sterile neutrinos, invoked to explain the neutrino short baseline (SBL)
anomaly. The latest MiniBooNE data on electron-neutrino appearance (Aguilar-Arevalo et al. 2018) support previous anomalous results by LSND (Aguilar-Arevalo et al. 2001), with a combined significance of 6.1 σ in favour of electron-neutrino appearance. However, this contradicts recent muon-neutrino disappearance data from MINOS+ and IceCube (Dentler et al. 2018),
when considered along with electron-antineutrino disappearance results (Dentler et al. 2017; Gariazzo et al. 2018), and also
appears to be excluded by OPERA (Agafonova et al. 2018).
The long-standing evidence for electron-neutrino disappearance
in reactor experiments has also recently been challenged by
new data from STEREO (Almazán et al. 2018) and PROSPECT
(Ashenfelter et al. 2018). It is worth noting, however, that removing any individual experiment does not relieve the tension
between the remaining experiments, and mild tension still persists if all electron (anti-)neutrino appearance (disappearance)
data are removed (see Maltoni 2018, for a detailed summary).
Several analyses have shown that in order to fit the anomalous
data sets with one sterile neutrino, one needs an active-sterile

Primordial helium. The latest estimates of the primordial helium abundance come from the data compilations of Aver et al.
(2015), giving YPBBN ≡ 4nHe /nb = 0.2449 ± 0.0040 (68 % CL)
and Peimbert et al. (2016), giving a slightly tighter constraint
YPBBN = 0.2446±0.0029 (68 % CL). These two estimates are consistent with each other. Izotov et al. (2014) find a higher value,
YPBBN = 0.2551 ± 0.0022 (68 % CL) in moderate (2.2 σ to 2.9 σ)
tension with the previous two. Aver et al. (2015) discuss the differences between their results and Izotov et al. (2014), which are
caused by modelling differences involving neutral hydrogen collisional emission, corrections for dust absorption, and helium
emissivities, amongst other effects. This raises the issue, which
has long-plagued helium abundance measurements, of whether
the systematic errors are accurately incorporated in the quoted
uncertainties. In this paper, we will use the more conservative
Aver et al. (2015) results as the baseline; however, we will occasionally quote bounds based on the combined Aver et al. (2015)
and Peimbert et al. (2016) results (YPBBN = 0.2447 ± 0.0023
(68 % CL)) and for the Izotov et al. (2014) results.
Compared to the measurement used in PCP15, the Aver et al.
(2015) error bar has decreased by a factor of 2.4. To relate the
primordial helium abundance to early Universe parameters under the assumption of standard BBN, we use two public BBN
codes: first, version 1.10 of PArthENoPE40 (Pisanti et al. 2008);
and second, the recently released PRIMAT code41 (Pitrou et al.
2018). The most relevant particle physics parameter for heliumabundance calculations is the neutron lifetime. PArthENoPE
1.10 uses the average value τn = (880.2 ± 1.0) s (68 % CL)
taken from the Particle Data Group summary (Patrignani et al.
2016). This is a very small shift with respect to the value of τn =
(880.3±1.1) s used in PCP15. The PRIMAT code uses instead an
average over post-2000 measurements only, τn = (879.5 ± 0.8) s
(68 % CL, Serebrov et al. 2018). The two codes find (consistently) that uncertainties of σ(τn ) = 1.0 s and 0.8 s correspond to
theoretical errors for the helium fraction of σ(YPBBN ) = 3.0×10−4
and 2.4 × 10−4 , respectively. Given the Planck result for the
baryon density in the base-ΛCDM model,
ωb = 0.02236 ± 0.00029 (95 %, TT,TE,EE+lowE),

Note that ∆Neff could in principle be reduced if there was a small
amount of lepton asymmetry in the early Universe; however, this would
raise other types of problems (Saviano et al. 2013).

only at the level of numerical methods and performance. The physical

The first set of error bars (in parentheses) reflects only the uncertainty on ωb , while the second set includes the theoretical
uncertainty σ(YPBBN ) added in quadrature. The two mean values are shifted by ∆YPBBN ≈ 4.2 × 10−4 because of differences
in the adopted neutron lifetime and because PRIMAT includes
a more elaborate treatment of weak interaction rates. However,
this shift is quite close to the theoretical errors estimated from
both codes, and about an order of magnitude smaller that the
observational error quoted by Aver et al. (2015). As shown in
Fig. 38, the results from both codes lie well within the region
favoured by the Aver et al. (2015) observations. They are also
compatible at the 1 σ level with the combined Aver et al. (2015)
and Peimbert et al. (2016) results, but in 3.6–3.8 σ tension with
the Izotov et al. (2014) results. Evidently, there is an urgent need
to resolve the differences between the helium abundance measurements and this tension should be borne in mind when we
use the Aver et al. (2015) measurements below.
Primordial deuterium. There has been significant progress related to deuterium abundance determination since the completion of PCP15. On the observational side, Cooke et al. (2018)
have published a new estimate based on their best seven
measurements in metal-poor damped Ly α systems, yDP ≡
105 nD /nH = 2.527 ± 0.030 (68 % CL). On the calculational
side, the value of the nuclear reaction rate d(p, γ)3 He, which
has a major impact on BBN computations of the primordial
deuterium calculation, has now been calculated ab initio. The

PCP15. We can now update it using the latest Planck and deuterium data.
We parameterize the thermal rate R2 (T ) of the d(p, γ)3 He
process in the PArthENoPE code by rescaling the rate Rex
2 (T ) fitted to experimental data by Adelberger et al. (2011) with a factor
A2 :
R2 (T ) = A2 Rex
2 (T ) .

(75)

This factor does not account in an exact way for the differences
between the experimental fit and the theoretical predictions; it
should instead be seen as a consistency parameter, very much
like AL for CMB lensing in Sect. 6.2. The rate Rth
2 (T ) predicted
by Marcucci et al. (2005) has a temperature dependence that is
close to what is measured experimentally, and can be very well
approximated by a rescaling factor A2 = 1.055. The new theoretical rate obtained by Marcucci et al. (2016) has a slightly different temperature dependence but is well approximated by an
effective rescaling factor Ath
2 = 1.16 (Mangano & Pisanti, private communication).
Assuming the base-ΛCDM model, we then constrain A2 using Planck data combined with the latest deuterium abundance
measurements from Cooke et al. (2018). We still need to take
into account theoretical errors on deuterium predictions arising
from uncertainties on other rates, and from the difference between various codes. According to Marcucci et al. (2016) and
Pitrou et al. (2018), the deuterium fusion uncertainties propagate
to an error σ(yDP ) = 0.03, which encompasses the difference
on deuterium predictions between PArthENoPE versus PRIMAT.
Thus we adopt σ(yDP ) = 0.03 as the theoretical error on deuterium predictions in this analysis. Adding the theoretical error
in quadrature to the observational error of Cooke et al. (2018),
we obtain a total error of σ(yDP ) = 0.042 on deuterium, which
we use in our joint fits of Planck+deutrium (D) data. We find
A2 = 1.138 ± 0.072 (68 %, Planck TT+lowE+D),
A2 = 1.080 ± 0.061

However, as noted in the previous section, there is some inconsistency between the helium abundance measurements reported
by different authors. If we use the helium abundance measurement of Izotov et al. (2014) in place of Aver et al. (2015) and
Peimbert et al. (2016), the mean value of Neff shifts by about
0.35 (e.g., for case (b), Neff = 3.37 ± 0.22 at the 95% level), in
2.9 σ tension with the standard model value of 3.046.
Note finally that one can obtain Neff bounds independently
of the details of the CMB spectra at high multipoles by combining the helium, deuterium, and BAO data sets with a nearly
model-independent prior on the scale of the sound horizon at decoupling inferred from Planck data, 100θMC = 1.0409 ± 0.0006

(76b)

If we compare these results with those from PCP15, the tension
between the Planck TT+lowE+D prediction and the experimental rate slightly increases to 1.9 σ. However the inclusion of polarization brings the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+D prediction halfway between the experimental value and the theoretical rate of
Marcucci et al. (2016), in agreement with both at the 1.3 σ level.
The situation is thus inconclusive and highlights the need for a
precise experimental determination of the d(p, γ)3 He rate with
LUNA (Gustavino 2017).
Varying the density of relic radiation. We can also relax the assumption that Neff = 3.046 to check the agreement between
CMB and primordial element abundances in the ωb –Neff plane.
Figure 39 shows that this agreement is very good, with a clear
overlap of the 95 % preferred regions of Planck and of the helium+deuterium measurements. This is true with any of our assumptions on the nuclear rates. For clarity in the plot, we only
include the predictions of PArthENoPE (cases (a) and (b)), but
those of PRIMAT are very close to case (b). Since all these data
sets are compatible with each other, we can combine them to
obtain marginalized bounds on Neff , valid in the 7-parameter

ΛCDM+Neff model, with an error bar reduced by up to 30 %

We now allow the helium fraction to vary independently of BBN,

YPBBN = 0.241 ± 0.025 (95 %, Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE),

The Planck constraints on YP and Ωb h2 are shown in Fig. 40,

Since both helium abundance and relativistic degrees of freedom affect the CMB damping tail, they are partially degenerate.
Allowing Neff to also vary in addition to YP , we obtain the somewhat weaker constraints:

In our main grid results we assume that YP can be determined
accurately using standard BBN predictions from PArthENoPE
based on a neutron lifetime τn = (880.2 ± 1.0) s. This uncertainty on τn is sufficiently small that it has negligible impact on
constraints for non-BBN parameters.
If the τn constraint is relaxed, for example to allow a systematic shift towards the beam measurement τn = [887 ± 1.2(stat.) ±
1.9(sys, )] s of Yue et al. (2013), there would be a slight shift in
cosmological parameters; however, taking the central value of
τn ≈ 887s would shift ΛCDM parameters by at most 0.2 σ (for
θMC ). As shown in Table 5 the base-ΛCDM parameters are very
stable to marginalization over YP with no constraint, at the expense of only modest increase in uncertainties. There is therefore only very limited scope for shifting the main Planck parameters by changing the BBN model, especially given the BBNindependent requirement of consistency with the observed helium abundances of Aver et al. (2015).
Finally, we can assume that standard BBN is an accurate
theory, but take τn as a free parameter to obtain an indirect
constraint on the neutron lifetime from CMB or CMB+helium
data. This is potentially interesting in the context of the longstanding difference between neutrino lifetime measurements
performed by beam and bottle experiments. The PDG result,
τn = (880.2 ± 1.0) s, is based on an average over two beam and
five bottle experiments (Patrignani et al. 2016). The beam-only
average gives τn = (888.0 ± 2.0) s, while the bottle-only average yields τn = (879.2 ± 0.6) s; these determinations are in 4.0 σ
tension. To derive an independent prediction, following the lines
of Salvati et al. (2016), we combine our ΛCDM+YP chains with
the function YPBBN (ωb , τn ) predicted by PArthENoPE or PRIMAT
to obtain a posterior probability distribution in (ωb , τn ) space.42
After marginalizing over ωb , for CMB-only data, we find

These constraints are shown in Fig. 41, and are again entirely consistent with standard assumptions. The direct helium
abundance measurement of Aver et al. (2015) provides significantly tighter constraints than those from Planck CMB measurements. By combining Planck with Aver et al. (2015) we obtain a

results do not provide a statistically significant preference for either the beam or bottle values. If we make a similar prediction by
combining Planck with the helium measurement of Izotov et al.
(2014), we obtain a range, τn = (920 ± 11)s (68 %CL), in 3.6 σ
tension with all direct measurements of the neutron lifetime; this
is a potentially interesting result, emphasizing again the need to
resolve tensions between different analyses of the primordial helium abundance.

For simplicity, here we fix the extra relativistic degrees of freedom
to the standard value Neff = 3.046; see Salvati et al. (2016) for discussion.

The cosmological recombination era marks an important phase
in the history of the Universe, determining precisely how
CMB photons decoupled from baryons around redshift z ≈ 103
(Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1970; Peebles & Yu 1970). With precision data from Planck, we can test physical assumptions of
the recombination process (Hu et al. 1995; Seljak et al. 2003),
studying both standard and non-standard physics.
The Planck data are sensitive to several subtle atomic physics
and radiative-transfer effects (see e.g., Chluba & Sunyaev 2006;
Kholupenko et al. 2007; Switzer & Hirata 2008) that were
omitted in earlier calculations of the recombination history
(Zeldovich et al. 1968; Peebles 1968; Seager et al. 2000). These
effects can lead to significant biases to several cosmological parameters (e.g., Rubiño-Martı́n et al. 2010; Shaw & Chluba
2011); however, as the Planck 2015 analysis confirmed, at
the present level of precision these can be reliably incorporated within the advanced recombination codes CosmoRec
(Chluba & Thomas 2011) and HyRec (Ali-Haı̈moud & Hirata
2010), as well as the recfast code (Seager et al. 1999;
Wong et al. 2008), modified using corrections calculated with
the more precise codes.
In this section, we update the PCP15 search for deviations
from the standard recombination history. In particular, improved
polarization data provide additional constraining power that warrants revisiting this question. As in 2015, we find no significant
indication for departures of the recombination history from the
standard prediction.
We use a semi-blind eigen-analysis (often referred to as a
principal-component analysis) of deviations of the free-electron
fraction, xe (z) = ne /nH , where nH denotes the number density of hydrogen nuclei, away from the standard recombination
history (Farhang et al. 2012, 2013). Specifically, a perturbation,
δxe (z)/xefid (z), is expanded in Nz = 80 bands of δz, spanning redshifts from well before helium recombination to well past hydrogen recombination (taken to be 200 ≤ z ≤ 3500). Here, xefid (z)
describes the ionization history, assuming the standard recombination physics and using the best-fitting cosmological parameters from Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE.
We then form the Fisher information matrix for the Nz +Nstd +
Nnuis parameters, corresponding to the xe -perturbation, standard
cosmological, and nuisance parameters, respectively. The Fisher
matrix is then inverted to obtain the parameter-parameter correlation matrix. Our focus is on the Nz × Nz block of this Fisher
inverse, containing the marginalized errors and correlations of
the xe parameters. The xe block is diagonalized, and the corresponding diagonal variances are rank-ordered from the lowest
to highest fluctuation variance (i.e., from the best to worst constrained mode). The rotation diagonalizing the Fisher inverse defines the xe eigenmodes. Truncation of the eigenmode hierarchy
to determine the number of xe modes used for parameter estimation is performed according to some suitably chosen selection
criterion. We refer to these modes as “eXeMs”, the first three
of which are shown in Fig. 42. Only a small number are probed
by Planck 2018 data, even with the addition of the higher quality polarization information. If instead we diagonalized the Nz
block of the Fisher matrix before inverting, the modes would be
characterized by the fixed best-fitting cosmological and nuisance
parameter values, i.e., they would not be marginalized. Those xe
modes differ from the eXeMs, but would give similar results (as
discussed in Farhang et al. 2012).
For our analysis, we use the eXeMs, applying them to the
Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO data combination. By

construction, these modes are orthogonal to each other;43 however, correlations arise once the standard and nuisance parameters are varied. This slightly modifies the errors and can also
cause small parameter biases (Farhang et al. 2012). Although the
lowest order xe modes given in PCP15 look similar to those for
the 2018 data, the precision of the Planck data requires the eigenanalysis to be updated around the new fiducial point in parameter
space; indeed, we find subtle differences, e.g., a small shift in the
position of the first mode, to which the data are sensitive.
As discussed in PCP15, the first mode corresponds mainly
to a change in the width and height of the Thomson visibility
function, while the second mode leads to a change in the position
of the visibility peak. The third mode introduces a superposition
of the change in the width, height, and position of the visibility
peak. Each mode causes a response in δC` /C`fid , as illustrated in
Fig. 43.
43

In practice, our mode generation method gives slight mode correlations at the level of 3–9 % due to the numerical procedure and smoothing of the mode-functions (see Farhang et al. 2012, for details).

Fig. 43. Power spectrum responses to the first three xe modes,
constructed using Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE, shown in Fig. 42.
For each curve, the corresponding xe mode was added to the
standard recombination history with an amplitude corresponding
to their predicted 1 σ uncertainties (i.e., σµ1 = 0.16, σµ2 = 0.23,
and σµ3 = 0.73 for the first three eXeMs).

In the eigen-analysis, each eXeM is multiplied by an amplitude, µi , which is determined by MCMC sampling along with
all of the other standard cosmological and nuisance parameters.
These amplitudes and their errors are summarized in Table 9 for
the data combination Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO.
There is stability in the amplitudes as the mode number is increased, and all are consistent with no deviation from standard
recombination within the errors. We also find that cosmological
parameters do not shift with the inclusion of these modes, agreeing well (though with slightly larger errors) with the ΛCDM values computed assuming the standard recombination history. The
four-mode case (not reported here) gives similar results, but with
slightly larger errors.
In PCP15, an equivalent exercise also showed no evidence
for deviations from the standard recombination history. Using
the 2015 Planck high-multipole temperature power spectra, only
two modes were well-constrained; however, adding the preliminary high-multipole polarization data in PCP15 allowed a third
mode to be constrained. The 2018 Planck temperature and im-

free electrons generated during reionization can scatter and partially damp the CMB anisotropies. This leads to a mostly scaleindependent suppression of power above ` ≈ 10 by a factor of

Here nreion
(z) is the number density of free electrons from reione
ization, nH (z) is the total number of hydrogen nuclei, and σT is
the Thomson scattering cross-section. We set zmax = 50, which is
early enough to capture the entirety of the expected contribution
from reionization. We assume that the first reionization of helium happens at the same time as the reionization of hydrogen,
so complete first reionization corresponds to xe > 1. There is
an additional increase in xe at z <
∼ 3.5 when the helium is fully
ionized; this only has a small contribution to τ and in all cases
we model it with a simple smooth transition at z = 3.5.
At large scales in polarization (` <
∼ 30), anisotropies are
instead created by the rescattering of the local temperature quadrupole, which varies maximally across Hubble-sized
patches. This leads to a “bump” today in the large-scale polarization power spectrum at the Hubble scale during reionization.
The amplitude of the bump scales like τ2 , but the exact shape
encodes information on the detailed evolution of the ionization fraction and can therefore constrain xe (z) (Zaldarriaga et al.
1997; Kaplinghat et al. 2003). Conversely, the inferred value of
τ depends on the model assumed for xe (z), thus the reionization history has implications for other cosmological parameters,
which are important to quantify. Throughout the 2018 papers,
we use the simple TANH model for reionization (described below and in Sect. 3.3). In this section, we augment this with two
other models to check whether our choice has any impact on
the τ constraints, and to assess the extent to which Planck data
can place model-independent bounds on reionization. The three
models we use are the following.
– TANH, which assumes a smooth transition from a neutral
to ionized Universe, with a parametric form for xe (z) based
on a hyperbolic tangent (see footnote 15). This model is not
physically motivated, but makes the optical depth approximately independent of the transition width (Lewis 2008). It
has been used previously in PCP13 and PCP15, and is the
default model in these 2018 papers.
– PCA (principle-component analysis), which decomposes the
reionization history into eigenmodes that form a complete
basis for any observable history (Hu & Holder 2003). In general, one must also specify a set of bounds to prevent the reconstruction from giving unphysical (e.g., negative) ionization fractions, and for this we use the optimal bounds given
in Millea & Bouchet (2018). The PCA model has some deficiencies: firstly, model parameters (the eigenmode amplitudes) do not have a straightforward physical interpretation;
secondly, even with the optimal physicality bounds, physicality cannot be enforced exactly (Mortonson & Hu 2008;
57

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

For each of these models, we must also specify the prior
on the model parameters, which in turn corresponds to some
particular prior on τ. Previous analyses of Planck data such
as Heinrich et al. (2017), Obied et al. (2018), Hazra & Smoot
(2017), or Villanueva-Domingo et al. (2018), have not considered the impact of these (sometimes implicit) priors, which differed among the different analyses and consequently caused
some partial disagreement between results. To allow direct comparison of τ values, unless otherwise stated we will use a prior
that is uniform on τ. Heinrich & Hu (2018) construct a prior
that is uniform on τ, but which increases the allowed unphysical parameter space and is chosen a posteriori. Here we instead use the flat prior constructed by the procedure described in
Millea & Bouchet (2018) and Handley & Millea (2019), which
does not admit extra unphysical models and gives the most
generic prior that leaves the prior on τ uniform.
Evidence based on observations of the Gunn-Peterson
trough in the spectra of high-redshift quasars show that the
inter-galactic medium is highly ionized by z ≈ 6 (see e.g.,
Bouwens et al. 2015). We enforce this bound in the case of the
TANH model by requiring that the central redshift of reionization be greater than z = 6.5; since the assumed duration in the
TANH model is ∆z = 0.5, this ensures that reionization is nearly
complete by z ≈ 6. The corresponding lower limit for the optical
depth is τ >
∼ 0.0430, modulo some small dependence on other
cosmological parameters. In the case of the FlexKnot model,
the Gunn-Peterson bounds are enforced by constraining the knot
redshifts to be at z > 6. Here, because the duration of reionization
is not specified and can effectively be instantaneous, the optical
depth can be as low as τ = 0.0385. The PCA model also implicitly includes the Gunn-Peterson bounds, since the eigenmodes
only have support within the range z ∈ [6, 30], although the imperfect physicality bounds do allow values of τ slightly below
0.0385.
We begin by giving results using only the lowE large-scale
polarization likelihood. As discussed in Sect. 2.2.3, this likelihood uses only EE information, and is restricted to ` ≤ 29; we
assume that the reionization information in the polarization spectrum at ` ≥ 30 is negligible, which is a good approximation for
most models that can fit the low-` data. The lowE data provide
constraints on reionization that are largely model independent,
i.e., insensitive to other cosmological parameters. For definiteness, we fix these other cosmological parameters to their bestfit values from Planck TT,TE,EE, in particular holding As e−2τ
rather than As fixed, which better reflects the impact that the
`>
∼ 10 data would have (we will comment at the end of this
section on how the high-` data affect τ). We plot posterior constraints from lowE in the top panel of Fig. 44. One can see the
moderate extent to which the hard cutoff of the Gunn-Peterson

Millea & Bouchet 2018). Nevertheless, the PCA approach
serves as a useful alternative for comparison, and although
we do not do so here, it can be used to construct an approximate likelihood that can be convenient way of exploring
other models (Heinrich & Hu 2018; Miranda et al. 2017).
– FlexKnot, which reconstructs any arbitrary reionization history using an interpolating function between a varying number of knots, with marginalization over the number of knots
(Millea & Bouchet 2018). Here, the model parameters are
directly tied to the physical quantity of the ionization fraction, and as such physicality can be enforced by design. This
model is the exact analogue of the model used in reconstructing the primordial power spectrum from Planck data
(Vázquez et al. 2012; Planck Collaboration XX 2016).

The three results are in good agreement, showing that the Planck
data prefer a late and fast transition from a neutral to an ionized universe, which all models can capture equally well. The
TANH result gives slightly higher optical depth than the others, which is primarily driven by the fixed duration of reionization assumed. The PCA result is slightly lower, and is partly
affected by the imperfect physicality priors that allow unphysical negative ionization fractions. The FlexKnot result represents our best model-independent estimate of the optical depth.
Nevertheless, the differences between this and the TANH result,
or between the FlexKnot result using either a flat prior on τ or
on the knot positions and amplitudes (the dashed line in Fig. 44),
are small. For example, these differences correspond to shifts in
σ8 of < 0.1 σ when used in conjunction with Planck TT,TE,EE
+lowE data. Thus, although future cosmological inferences will
depend somewhat on the details of reionization (Allison et al.
2015; Millea & Bouchet 2018), current Planck data are quite robust to how reionization is modelled.
The FlexKnot approach provides a model-independent reconstruction of the entire reionization history, with physicality
enforced exactly. This reconstruction is presented in Fig. 45. A
comparison against the TANH model is also shown; although
this imposes a fixed shape on the evolution, it nevertheless
matches the FlexKnot constraint fairly well. We find no preference for any significant high-redshift contribution to the optical depth. This conclusion does not depend qualitatively on
our choice of prior either; we have checked both a prior that
is uniform on the knot positions and amplitudes, and one that is
uniform on the contribution to τ between redshifts 15 and 30,

τ(15, 30). We find44 :
τ(15, 30) < 0.018 (lowE, flat τ(15, 30), FlexKnot);
τ(15, 30) < 0.023 (lowE, flat knot, FlexKnot).

(87a)
(87b)

This can be compared with the results of Heinrich et al.
(2017) and Obied et al. (2018), who found a roughly 2 σ preference for non-zero τ(15, 30) using Planck 2015 data (which
included a large-scale polarization likelihood from the LFI instrument). Millea & Bouchet (2018) showed that the majority of
this preference disappeared when using the lower-noise Planck
HFI SimLow likelihood (Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI 2016),
with an additional sub-dominant effect due to the choice of prior.
The upper bound on the contribution from z > 15 to the
total optical depth limits some candidate explanations of the
anomalously large 21-cm signal from the EDGES experiment
(Bowman et al. 2018). Some otherwise plausible explanations
also lead, as a side-effect, to a significant number of ionizing
photons being generated at high redshift, enough to contribute
significantly to τ(15, 30). These models are now highly disfavoured by the Planck bound in their simplest forms (see e.g.,
Ewall-Wice et al. 2018).
CMB data also probe high-redshift reionization via the
patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect (Gruzinov & Hu
1998; Knox et al. 1998). Planck data, together with smallerscale ACT and SPT data (which are even more sensitive to this effect), give upper bounds on the amplitude
of the patchy kSZ power spectrum and thus on the duration of reionization (Zahn et al. 2012; Sievers et al. 2013;
Planck Collaboration Int. XLVII 2016). We do not attempt to derive new constraints here, since it is not completely straightforward to turn a limit on the amplitude of the patchy kSZ signal into one on the duration of reionization, especially given the
generic non-physical models for the ionization fraction that we
use here. However, in the future kSZ should be a powerful probe
of the details of reionization, in particular with low-noise smallscale temperature measurements over large fractions of the sky
(Smith & Ferraro 2017; Ferraro & Smith 2018).
The lower panel of Fig. 44 compares the optical depth posteriors from different likelihoods. Results from the large-scale LFI
polarization (Planck Collaboration V 2020) are in broad agreement with lowE, although with larger errors. The Planck lensing reconstruction data described in Sect. 2.3 can also provide
a completely separate (although more model-dependent) determination of the value of τ; lensing is directly sensitive to As ,
and hence can partially break the As e−2τ degeneracy. By using
the high-` data in conjunction with the reconstructed lensingpotential power spectrum, both of which are sensitive to lensing,
we can infer comparable constraints on τ. These are shown in
the bottom panel of Fig. 44. Although the peak of the τ posterior lies at higher values in this case, the difference between the
τ estimates from e.g., lowE and Planck TT,TE,EE+lensing is
44
Corrigendum: In the original published version of this paper, the
bounds given in Eqs. (87a) and (87b) on the contribution to the earlytime optical depth, τ(15, 30), contained a numerical error in deriving
the 95th percentile from the Monte Carlo samples. These corrected
bounds are a factor of ∼ 3 larger than the originally reported results.
Consequently, the new bounds do not significantly improve upon previous results from Planck data presented in Millea & Bouchet (2018) as
was stated, but are instead comparable. Equations. (87a) and (87b) give
results that are now similar to those of Heinrich & Hu (2021), who used
the same Planck 2018 data to derive a 95 % upper bound of 0.020 using
the principal component analysis (PCA) model and uniform priors on
the PCA mode amplitudes.

only 1.4 σ (where we compute the difference in posterior mean
with respect to the Gaussian error bars combined in quadrature).
The preference for higher τ is driven by the same features in the
CMB power spectrum data that prefer more lensing in ΛCDM
(giving AL > 1; see Sect. 6.2): the lensing amplitude can increased by increasing As , which at constant As e−2τ also increases
τ. Marginalizing over non-ΛCDM parameters, for example ΩK
(which can also increase lensing by having ΩK < 0), can reduce
the pull to higher τ, but does not change As e−2τ or the shape of
the reionization bump significantly enough to affect the largescale polarization result. This type of model-independence has
motivated our focus on only large-scale polarization data in this
section, although of course constraints on τ including higher` data (as are presented throughout the rest of this paper) are
equally valid, bearing in mind which model is assumed. Also,
results in other sections do not apply the lower bound from the
Gunn-Peterson constraint, which reduces the posterior mean values, somewhat disguising the larger peak values of the optical
depth.
Overall, the results in this section leave us with a picture
of reionization that happened late and fast, and are consistent
with reionization being driven by photons from massive stars
in low mass galaxies (see e.g. Robertson et al. 2015; Parsa et al.
2018). Our results are also consistent with observations suggesting that the Universe is substantially neutral at redshift z >
∼
7.5 (Banados et al. 2018; Davies et al. 2018; Mason et al. 2018).
The low value of the optical depth makes the Planck constraints
very robust to the details of reionization modelling, with the simple TANH model adopted in this paper causing no significant
biases in other parameters.
7.9. Dark-matter annihilation

CMB anisotropies are sensitive to energy injection in the intergalactic medium that could be a consequence, for example, of
dark-matter (DM) annihilation (see discussion in section 6.6. of
PCP15 and references therein). The current CMB sensitivity to
the annihilation cross section of weakly-interactive massive particles (WIMPs) is competitive with and complementary to that
of indirect DM search experiments. The effective parameter constrained by CMB anisotropies is
pann ≡ feff

hσvi
,
mχ

(88)

where mχ is the DM particle mass, hσvi its thermally averaged annihilation cross-section (assumed here to be independent of temperature and redshift, as predicted for WIMPs annihilating in s-wave channels), and feff is the fraction of the energy released by the annihilation process that is transferred to
the intergalactic medium (IGM) around the redshifts to which
the CMB anisotropy data are most sensitive, namely z ≃ 600
(Finkbeiner et al. 2012).
For each value of pann , we compute CMB anisotropies using
the ExoClass branch (Stöcker et al. 2018) of class v2.6.3, with
recombination solved by HyRec v2017 (Ali-Haimoud & Hirata
2011). We assume that the energy injected by DM annihilation
is immediately transferred to the IGM (the “on-the-spot” approximation), and splits between gas heating and hydrogen excitation/ionization, according to the calculations summarized in
Table V of Galli et al. (2013). Helium ionization and beyond onthe-spot effects can be safely neglected here. Since CMB anisotropies are very weakly sensitive to the redshift dependence of
the transferred energy fraction f (z), we assume a constant fraction f (z) = feff .

The bound based on CMB temperature and polarization data improves by 17 % compared to PCP15. The difference is driven by
the new high-` TT,TE,EE likelihood. This is consistent with the
fact that in addition to changing the physics of recombination,
and thus the scale and height of the acoustic peaks, DM annihilation enhances the freeze-out value of the ionization fraction
of the Universe after recombination, and introduces a distinctive signature in the polarization spectrum for ` ≤ 200. The
new bounds are not only stronger but also more robust, since
polarization systematics in the Planck polarization spectra are
now better understood. Adding Planck lensing and BAO further
tightens the constraints.
In the baseline version of the Plik likelihood, the calibration
parameters of the polarization data, which correct for polarization efficiencies, are fixed to the values computed assuming the
base-ΛCDM model, as described in Sect. 2.2.1. This is not necessarily consistent when the ionization history is substantially
modified by energy injection from DM or other mechanisms. We
thus performed further analyses in which the polarization calibration parameters are varied, with a flat prior within the range
0.8–1.2. We found that our bounds remain unaffected by floating
these additional nuisance parameters, which are not correlated
with pann .
Figure 46 translates the bounds on pann into joint limits on
the mass mχ and annihilation cross-section hσvi of DM, assuming twelve plausible WIMP s-wave annihilation channels. The
value of feff for each mass and channel was computed45 using the
public DarkAges module of Stöcker et al. (2018), which relies
on the energy transfer functions presented by Slatyer (2016b).
We consistently account for corrections related to low-energy
photons in the manner described in section V.B. of Slatyer
(2016b). Finally, the DarkAges module defines feff by convolving f (z) in redshift space with the weighting function recommended by Slatyer (2016a). Note that for the W + W − and Z 0 Z 0
channels, the bounds assume on-shell 2-body processes and are
cut sharply at the mass of the daughter particle, while in reality
they would extend further to the left in Fig. 46.
As usual the strongest bounds are obtained assuming annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The case of annihilation
purely into neutrinos is not shown here, since the constraints
are orders of magnitude weaker in that case. Assuming a thermal cross-section (shown in Fig. 46), the 95 % CL lower bounds
on the DM mass range from mχ ≥ 9 GeV for annihilation
into tau/anti-tau, up to mχ ≥ 30 GeV for annihilation in electron/positron. To compare with hints of DM annihilation in indirect DM search data, we first show the regions preferred by the
AMS/PAMELA positron fraction and Fermi/H.E.S.S. electronpositron flux, assuming s-wave annihilation into muons and
standard halo profiles. These regions, taken from Cirelli et al.
(2009), have long been known to be in strong tension with CMB
data.

Fig. 46. Planck 2018 constraints on DM mass and annihilation cross-section. Solid straight lines show joint CMB constraints on
several annihilation channels (plotted using different colours), based on pann < 3.2 × 10−28 cm3 s−1 GeV−1 . We also show the 2 σ
preferred region suggested by the AMS proton excess (dashed ellipse) and the Fermi Galactic centre excess according to four
possible models with references given in the text (solid ellipses), all of them computed under the assumption of annihilation into bb̄
(for other channels the ellipses would move almost tangentially to the CMB bounds). We additionally show the 2 σ preferred region
suggested by the AMS/PAMELA positron fraction and Fermi/H.E.S.S. electron and positron fluxes for the leptophilic µ+ µ− channel
(dotted contours). Assuming a standard WIMP-decoupling scenario, the correct value of the relic DM abundance is obtained for a
“thermal cross-section” given as a function of the mass by the black dashed line.
We also indicate the regions suggested by the possible DM
interpretation of several anomalies in indirect DM search data.
The 95 % CL preferred region for the AMS anti-proton excess
is extracted from Cuoco et al. (2017b,a). The DM interpretation
of the Fermi Galactic centre excess is very model-dependent
and, as in figure 9 of Charles et al. (2016), we choose to show
four results from the analyses of Gordon & Macias (2013),
Abazajian et al. (2014), Calore et al. (2015), and Daylan et al.
(2016). For the Fermi Galactic centre excess and the AMS antiproton excess, we only show results assuming annihilation into
bb̄, in order to keep the figure readable. About 50 % of the region
found by Abazajian et al. (2014) is excluded by CMB bounds,
while other regions are still compatible. The 95 % CL preferred
region for the AMS anti-proton excess is still compatible with
CMB bounds for the bb̄ channel shown in the figure, and we
checked that this is also the case for other channels.

8. Conclusions
This is the final Planck collaboration paper on cosmological parameters and presents our best estimates of parameters defining
the base-ΛCDM cosmology and a wide range of extended models. As in PCP13 and PCP15 we find that the base-ΛCDM model
provides a remarkably good fit to the Planck power spectra and
lensing measurements, with no compelling evidence to favour
any of the extended models considered in this paper.
Compared to PCP15 the main changes in this analysis
come from improvements in the Planck polarization analysis,
both at low and high multipoles. The new Planck polarization maps provide a tight constraint on the reionization optical depth, τ, from large-scale polarization (and are consistent with the preliminary HFI polarization results presented
in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016)). This revision to the
constraint on τ accounts for most of the (small) changes in parameters determined from the temperature power spectra in this
paper compared to PCP15. We have characterized a number of

systematic effects, neglected in PCP15, which affect the polarization spectra at high multipoles. Applying corrections for these
systematics (principally arising from errors in polarization efficiencies and temperature-to-polarization leakage) we have produced high multipole TT,TE,EE likelihoods that provide substantially tighter constraints than using temperature alone. We
have compared two TT,TE,EE likelihoods that use different assumptions to correct for polarization systematics and find consistency at the <
∼ 0.5 σ level. Although the TT,TE,EE likelihoods
are not perfect, the Planck parameter results presented in this paper can be considered accurate to within their error bars.
Our main conclusions include the following.
• The 6-parameter base-ΛCDM model provides a good fit to
the Planck TT, TE, and EE power spectra and to the Planck
CMB lensing measurements, either individually or in combination with each other.
• The CMB angular acoustic scale is measured robustly at
0.03 % precision to be θ∗ = (0.◦ 5965 ± 0.◦ 0002), and is one of
the most accurately measured parameters in cosmology, of comparable precision to the measurement of the background CMB
temperature (Fixsen 2009).
• The Planck best fit base-ΛCDM cosmology is in very good
agreement with BAO, supernovae, redshift-space distortion measurements and BBN predictions for element abundance observations. There is some tension (at about 2.5 σ) with high-redshift
BAO measurements from quasar Ly α observations, but no standard extension of the base-ΛCDM cosmology improves the fit
to these data.
• The new low-` polarization likelihood tightens the reionization optical depth significantly compared to the 2015 analysis,
giving τ = 0.054 ± 0.007, suggesting a mid-point reionization
redshift of zre = 7.7 ± 0.7. This is consistent with astrophysical observations of quasar absorption lines and models in which
reionization happened relatively fast and late. We investigated
more general models of reionization and demonstrated that our
61

Planck Collaboration: Cosmological parameters

cosmological parameter results are insensitive to residual uncertainties in the reionization history.
• The primordial fluctuations are consistent with Gaussian
purely adiabatic scalar perturbations characterized by a power
spectrum with a spectral index ns = 0.965 ± 0.004, consistent with the predictions of slow-roll, single-field, inflation.
Combined with BAO, we find that the Universe is spatially flat
to high accuracy (ΩK = 0.0007 ± 0.0019), consistent the predictions of simple inflationary models. Combining with BICEPKeck 2015 data on B-mode polarization we find a 95 % upper
limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 < 0.06. Together with
our measurement of ns , these results favour concave over convex
inflation potentials, suggesting a hierarchy between the slow-roll
parameters measuring the slope and curvature of the potential.
• The Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology predicts a late-time
clustering amplitude σ8 = 0.811 ± 0.006, and matter density
parameter Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007. The parameter S 8 ≡ σ8 Ω0.5
m =
0.831 ± 0.013 is compatible with DES galaxy lensing, and joint
Planck-DES lensing results, although in modest tension with
DES results that also include galaxy clustering, which prefer a
roughly 2.5 σ lower value of S 8 . There is no obvious inconsistency between the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology and counts of
clusters (selected either through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect or via X-ray luminosity) because of large uncertainties in
the calibrations of cluster masses.
• The Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology requires a Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 ± 0.5) km s−1 Mpc−1 , in substantial 4.4 σ tension with the latest local determination by Riess et al. (2019).
The Planck measurement is in excellent agreement with independent inverse-distance-ladder measurements using BAO, supernovae, and element abundance results. None of the extended
models that we have studied in this paper convincingly resolves
the tension with the Riess et al. (2019) value of H0 .
• Allowing for extra relativistic degrees of freedom, we measure the effective number of degrees of freedom in non-photon
radiation density to be Neff = 2.89 ± 0.19 (Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17
including BAO data), consistent with the value 3.046 expected
in the standard model. Light thermal relics that decoupled after
the QCD phase transition are ruled out at the 2 σ level. Allowing
for larger Neff can slightly reduce tension with the local H0 measurement and be consistent with BAO; however, the marginalized constraint on H0 remains in tension with Riess et al. (2019)
at over 3 σ and higher values of Neff are not favoured by element
abundance observations.
• Combining Planck data with Pantheon supernovae and BAO
data, the equation of state of dark energy is tightly constrained
to w0 = −1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant.
We have also investigated a variety of modified-gravity models,
finding no significant evidence for deviations from ΛCDM.
• Allowing for a free degenerate active neutrino mass, and
combining with BAO measurements,
P we obtain the tight 95 %
constraint on the sum of the masses mν < 0.12 eV.
• We find good agreement between the predictions of BBN
for the Planck base-ΛCDM parameters and element abundance
observations. Uncertainties in nuclear rates currently dominate
the error budget for the interpretation of deuterium abundances.
• We have investigated a number of models for massive sterile
neutrinos and dark-matter annihilation, finding no evidence for
deviations from base ΛCDM.
The overall picture from Planck, since our first results were
presented in PCP13, is one of remarkable consistency with the
6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. This consistency is strengthened with the addition of the polarization spectra presented in
this paper. Nevertheless, there are a number of curious “ten62

sions,” both internal to the Planck data (the tendency for Planck
to favour AL > 1, discussed in Sect. 6.2, is an example) and
with some external data sets. Some of these tensions may reflect small systematic errors in the Planck data (though we have
not found any evidence for errors that could significantly change
our results) and/or systematic errors in external data. However,
none of these, with the exception of the discrepancy with direct measurements of H0 , is significant at more than the 2–3 σ
level. Such relatively modest discrepancies generate interest, in
part, because of the high precision of the Planck data set. We
could, therefore, disregard these tensions and conclude that the
6-parameter ΛCDM model provides an astonishingly accurate
description of the Universe from times prior to 380 000 years
after the Big Bang, defining the last-scattering surface observed
via the CMB, to the present day at an age of 13.8 billion years.
Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that the main
ingredients of ΛCDM, namely inflation, dark energy, and dark
matter are not understood at any fundamental level. There is,
therefore, a natural tendency to speculate that “tensions” may
be hints of new physics, especially given that the landscape
of possible new physics is immense. In the post-Planck era,
the CMB provides enormous potential for further discovery via
high-sensitivity ground-based polarization experiments and possibly a fourth-generation CMB satellite. The next decade will
see an ambitious programme of large BAO and weak lensing
surveys, and new techniques such as deep 21-cm surveys and
gravitational wave experiments. Uncovering evidence for new
physics is therefore a realistic possibility. What we have learned,
and the legacy from Planck, is that any signatures of new physics
in the CMB must be small.

Appendix A: Cosmological parameters from

CamSpec
Section 2.2 summarized the two high-multipole likelihoods used
in this paper. We stated that the two codes give very similar answers in T T but show some differences in T E and EE. We discuss these differences in more detail in this Appendix. Table 1
compares the base-ΛCDM parameters from Plik and CamSpec
for the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing likelihood combinations, showing that the two codes return cosmological parameters that agree to within a fraction of a standard deviation.
Table A.1 is the equivalent of Table 2, but using the CamSpec
likelihood in place of Plik. In T T , the parameters determined
from the two codes agree to 0.2 σ or better. The agreement is
less good in T E; the most discrepant parameters are ns , which
is 1 σ higher in CamSpec, and As e−2τ , which is 1.2 σ higher in
CamSpec. Both of these parameters are sensitive to the calibration of the polarization spectra which differ in the two codes.
The other cosmological parameters agree to better than 0.5 σ and
the shifts in parameters between T E and T T are similar in both
codes. In EE, the parameter shifts compared to T T are similar
in both codes, although the EE parameters from the two codes
typically differ by almost 1 σ. Since EE from Planck is so noisy,
the EE differences have little impact on the combined TT,TE,EE
parameters.
The differences listed in Table 1 can be seen visually in
Fig. A.1, which is the equivalent of Fig. 5 in Sect. 3, comparing base-ΛCDM parameters determined separately from TT, TE,
and EE, and the combined result from the TT,TE,EE CamSpec
likelihood. The two figures are remarkably similar, given the different methodologies and choices (e.g., polarization masks, multipole cuts, etc.) used to construct the polarization blocks of the
likelihoods. For the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the two likelihoods
are in such close agreement that it would make no difference to
any of the science conclusions in this paper if we used CamSpec
in place of Plik.
The small differences between the Plik and CamSpec TT
likelihoods are probably due to underestimates of the modelling
uncertainties because the foreground models in the two codes
are almost identical. A more accurate impression of foregroundmodelling uncertainties can be gleaned by comparing the default model with a heuristic foreground model applied to spectra, cleaned using the 545-GHz temperature maps, as described
in section 3.2 of PCP15. Since the low-frequency and highfrequency maps have different beams, the subtraction is actually
done in the power spectrum domain:
Ĉ Tν1 Tν2 clean = (1 + αTν1 )(1 + αTν2 )Ĉ Tν1 Tν2
−(1 + αTν1 )αTν2 Ĉ Tν1 Tνt
−(1 + αTν2 )αTν1 Ĉ Tν2 Tνt + αTν1 αTν2 Ĉ Tνt Tνt ,

(A.1)

(e.g., Spergel et al. 2015), where Ĉ Tν1 Tν2 etc. are the maskdeconvolved beam-corrected power spectra at low frequencies
and νt is the frequency of the template map. The coefficients αTνi
are determined by minimizing

As in PCP15 we choose `min = 100 and `max = 500 and compute the spectra in Eq. (A.1) by cross-correlating half-mission
maps using the 60 % mask used to compute the 217 × 217 spectrum. The resulting cleaning coefficients are αT143 = 0.00198

Fig. A.1. The equivalent of Fig. 5 using CamSpec in place of Plik, showing constraints on parameters of the base-ΛCDM model
using the high-` TT, TE, and EE separately (with the EE results also including BAO), and the combined result from the TT,TE,EE
likelihood.
and αT217 = 0.00763 (very close to the coefficients adopted in
PCP15); note that all of the input maps here are in units of thermodynamic temperature. The cleaned half-mission 143 × 143,
143 × 217 and 217 × 217 spectra are compared with uncleaned
CamSpec spectra (using the same masks for both sets of spectra)
and default foreground model in Fig. A.2.
To model residual foregrounds in the cleaned spectra, we assume that they follow power-laws, A f (`/1500)γ f characterized
by an amplitudes and spectral indices for each of the 143 × 143,
143 × 217 and 217 × 217 spectra together with kinetic and
thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich templates, as in the default foreground model. We assume the default foreground model for the
100 × 100 spectrum. We then form a CamSpec “cleaned” likelihood (used in several places in the main body of this paper)
using the same covariance matrices as those computed for the
uncleaned likelihood. Comparing parameters for the TT+lowE
likelihood combination, the cleaned and uncleaned cosmological
parameters agree to a fraction of a standard deviation, with θMC
and ns from the cleaned likelihood each lower by 0.3 σ. We conclude that systematics associated with modelling foregrounds do
not introduce significant biases in cosmological parameter determinations.
Table A.2 gives CamSpec results for extensions to the baseΛCDM cosmology, which is the equivalent to Table 4, but with
the addition of results for the CamSpec cleaned TT+lowE likelihood. The CamSpec and Plik likelihoods give closely similar
results for these extensions. The only noteworthy differences are
the TT,TE,EE results for ΩK , this being slightly closer to zero
in the CamSpec likelihood (we find similar behaviour for the
lensing consistency parameter AL , as discussed in Sect. 6.2) and
somewhat weaker constraints on Σmν and r. These differences
give an indication of the sensitivity of our results to different
methods and choices made in constructing the TT,TE,EE likelihoods and, in particular, to the schemes used to calibrate effective polarization efficiencies. A detailed description of CamSpec,
70

including further justification of the methodology used to construct the polarization blocks of the likelihood, is given in
Efstathiou & Gratton (2019).

Fig. A.2. Residual plots illustrating the sensitivity of the T T spectra to foreground modelling. The blue points in the upper panels
show the CamSpec half-mission cross-spectra after subtraction of the best-fit ΛCDM spectrum fit to TT+lowE. The residuals in
the upper panel should be accurately described by the foreground model. Major foreground components are shown by the solid
lines, colour coded as follows: total foreground spectrum (red); Poisson point sources (orange); clustered CIB (blue); thermal SZ
(green); and Galactic dust (purple). Minor foreground components are shown by the dotted lines, colour coded as follows: kinetic
SZ (green); and tSZ×CIB cross-correlation (purple). The red points in the upper panel panels show the 545 GHz-cleaned spectra
(minus best-fit CMB, as subtracted from the uncleaned spectra) that are fit to a power-law residual foreground model, as discussed
in the text. The lower panels show the spectra after subtraction of the best-fit foreground models. The χ2 values of the residuals of
the blue points, and the number of band powers, are listed in the lower panels.
