Abstract
We construct supersymmetric AdS4 vacua of type IIB string theory in compactifications on orientifolds of Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces. We first find explicit orientifolds and quantized fluxes for which the superpotential takes the form proposed
by Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, and Trivedi. Given very mild assumptions on the numerical values of the Pfaffians, these compactifications admit vacua in which all moduli
are stabilized at weak string coupling. By computing high-degree Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants we give strong evidence that the α0 expansion is likewise well-controlled.
We find extremely small cosmological constants, with magnitude < 10−123 in Planck
units. The compactifications are large, but not exponentially so, and hence these
vacua manifest hierarchical scale-separation, with the AdS length exceeding the
Kaluza-Klein length by a factor of a googol.

Introduction

To understand the effects of the quantization of gravity in cosmology, one can search for
cosmological solutions of string theory. A first step is to characterize isolated vacua in
well-controlled settings, such as the four-dimensional N = 1 supergravity theories that
arise in compactifications of type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds.
Our goal in this work is to find supersymmetric AdS4 vacua of the type proposed by
Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, and Trivedi (KKLT) [1]. Three conditions are necessary for such
vacua to exist. First, the expectation value of the classical flux superpotential must be
exponentially small. Second, the nonperturbative superpotential must contain at least h1,1
independent terms for the h1,1 Kähler moduli. Third, there must exist a point inside the
Kähler cone at which the F-terms for all the Kähler moduli vanish, and the α0 and gs expansions are well-controlled. An important open problem is to determine how widely these
requirements are fulfilled in ensembles of flux compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifolds.
To compute the nonperturbative superpotential in such a compactification, one needs
to identify the seven-brane gauge groups that generate gaugino condensates, and also find
all the rigid divisors that support Euclidean D3-brane superpotential terms. The leading
superpotential terms then take the form
W = Wflux (z, τ ) +

X



AD (z, τ ) exp − c2πD TD .

(1.1)

D

Here Wflux (z, τ ) is the classical Gukov-Vafa-Witten flux superpotential [2], which depends
on the complex structure moduli z and the axiodilaton τ . The sum runs over nonperturbative contributions supported on divisors D with complexified volumes TD , either from
Euclidean D3-branes when D is suitably rigid, or from strong gauge dynamics on a stack
of seven-branes wrapping D. In the former case cD = 1, while in the latter cD is the dual
Coxeter number of the gauge theory. The Pfaffian prefactors AD (z, τ ) in general depend
on the complex structure moduli and the axiodilaton.
Computing the dependence of the Pfaffians AD (z, τ ) on the moduli remains challenging,
but for divisors whose uplifts to F-theory have trivial intermediate Jacobian, the AD are
sections of the trivial bundle over moduli space [3, 4]. This constancy with respect to the
moduli simplifies the study of moduli stabilization (cf. e.g. [4]), and for this reason we will
ensure that every Pfaffian occurring in our studies is constant.
Recent advances have made it possible to find quantized fluxes for which1 W0 :=

To avoid writing |W0 | throughout, we have defined W0 to be positive, and we write instead hWflux i
for the rare cases where phase information is relevant.

h|Wflux |i  1 [5–9]. However, the problem of finding such fluxes is Diophantine in character, and the computation becomes extremely expensive for h2,1  1. Prior to the present
work, examples had been found only for h2,1 = 2 and 3, but one learns from the KreuzerSkarke list [10] that the smallest value of h1,1 for a Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface with
h2,1 ≤ 3 is 21.2
Thus, in the cases where one can find fluxes yielding exponentially small values of the
flux superpotential, the Kähler moduli space is high-dimensional. As a result, in seeking
supersymmetric AdS4 vacua in such geometries one encounters certain challenges. First,
one needs to construct explicit orientifolds at h1,1  1. Second, one needs to count
fermion zero-modes on Euclidean D3-branes in such orientifolds, and find cases in which
there are enough nonperturbative superpotential terms. Third, one needs to actually find
supersymmetric vacua in this high-dimensional moduli space, consisting of exponentially
many chambers of the Kähler cone. Finally, establishing control of the α0 expansion in
such vacua involves computing Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of curves at large h1,1 .
In this paper we overcome these obstacles. We exhibit compactifications in which the
superpotential takes the form (1.1), containing at least h1,1 independent nonperturbative
terms, all with constant Pfaffians, and with W0 as small as 10−95 . The examples are explicit
orientifolds of Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces with 4 ≤ h2,1 ≤ 7 and 51 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 214,
in which all tadpoles are cancelled. We show that with very mild assumptions about
the numerical values of the Pfaffians, these compactifications admit supersymmetric AdS4
vacua. All closed string moduli are explicitly stabilized, near weak string coupling, large
complex structure, and large Einstein-frame volumes. All seven-branes occur in so(8)
stacks, and we argue that the seven-brane moduli are therefore automatically stabilized in
the presence of three-form fluxes. By computing the genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants
to high degree, we give strong evidence that the leading worldsheet instanton corrections
to the Kähler potential are well-controlled.
Because our constructions unite a number of nontrivial components, the critical reader
may wonder which components are most likely to ‘fail’, i.e. which are the least understood,
or the most vulnerable to higher-order corrections of some form. To address this question,
we briefly summarize the status of our examples. The orientifolds, and the classical flux
vacua with W0  1, are extremely well-controlled. In particular, we have computed the
type IIA worldsheet instanton corrections to the prepotential up to curves of degree much
higher than those that generate the racetrack of [5], and have verified that the omitted terms
are indeed negligible. The D7-brane gauge sectors are all so(8) stacks with well-understood

We have found new solutions with h2,1 as large as 7, but h1,1 remains large: in the examples detailed
in §6, h1,1 ≥ 51.

low-energy dynamics. The Euclidean D3-branes in our examples are straightforward: they
wrap prime toric divisors D that are rigid, i.e. with h• (OD ) = (1, 0, 0), and intersect the O7planes transversely, so that the counting of fermion zero-modes is standard, see e.g. [11].

M5-brane partition function is a section of the trivial bundle, i.e. a pure constant, with
no dependence on the complex structure moduli [3]. In sum, the superpotential is very
well-characterized: we have shown explicitly that it takes the form proposed in [1], and
the only presently-unknown parameters in the leading superpotential data are the constant
prefactors AD of the nonperturbative terms, which we term Pfaffian numbers.
We lack a theory of the Pfaffian numbers, but will show that as long as they are not
exponentially large or small, our compactifications admit supersymmetric AdS4 vacua. Setting all the AD → 1 leads to a relative error in the expectation values of the Kähler moduli
that is of order log(AD )/ log(W0 ), and so for sufficiently small W0 , as in our examples, the
numerical values of the Pfaffians become irrelevant.
Crucially, because W0 is exponentially small, the string coupling gs is stabilized at
very weak coupling. Perturbative corrections in gs , and the effects of Euclidean D(-1)branes, can then be neglected. We further argue that because of the smallness of gs , and
correspondingly the weakness of the N = 2 → N = 1 breaking effects of fluxes and Dbranes, the leading corrections in the α0 expansion are not perturbative3 corrections, but
are instead N = 2 corrections from worldsheet instantons wrapping curves.
In sum, of all the possible corrections to the vacuum structure that one obtains from
the superpotential (1.1) and the leading-order Kähler potential, we find that the most
significant ones are the contributions of worldsheet instantons to the Kähler potential.
Evaluating such worldsheet instantons in a Calabi-Yau threefold is conceptually straightforward: one need only compute the genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of curves, for
example by means of mirror symmetry [13]. In practice, however, systematic computation
of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in compact Calabi-Yau threefolds with many Kähler moduli
has not yet been achieved, to the best of our knowledge: except in special cases, threefolds
with h1,1  10 have remained inaccessible.4 Yet in our ensemble of vacua, h1,1 is no smaller
than 51, and in fact h1,1 ∼ O(100) in many examples. In order to ensure convergence of
the α0 expansion in our solutions, we apply improved methods — to appear in [15] — for
computing genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in compact Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces. We compute these invariants systematically, to rather high degree, and we apply
specialized techniques to identify and study the smallest curves that are not collapsible.

Except for the famous term at order α03 [12], which we show is negligible.
See for example the recent work [14].

With the aid of these new computational tools, we establish control of the worldsheet instanton corrections, and a fortiori of the (largely unknown) perturbative-in-α0 corrections
that are suppressed by one or more additional powers of gs  1.
The construction of flux vacua employed here has been shown [6, 7] to be compatible
with the existence of near-conifold regions, including Klebanov-Strassler throat regions [16]
that could plausibly host supersymmetry-breaking anti-D3-branes [17]. However, establishing the validity of the supergravity approximation in such regions, for the Kähler moduli
expectation values obtained in our vacua, will require separate treatment. Moreover, introducing supersymmetry breaking leads to a further host of issues. The search for de Sitter
vacua based on our solutions is therefore left as a task for the future.
The pioneering works [18–20] already presented evidence for the existence of supersymmetric AdS4 vacua of KKLT type, so we should explain what has been gained in our
approach. First of all, in [18–20] the methods for finding flux vacua with W0  1 were less
powerful, and the smallest value obtained was O(10−2 ), whereas we have found examples
with W0 as small as5 10−95 . Second, the constructions of [18–20] relied on special structures:
a key example in [18] stabilized the complex structure moduli on the locus invariant under
the Greene-Plesser symmetry [22], which presents certain subleties; a very high degree of
symmetry among the various divisors is crucial in [19]; and the approach of [20] is restricted
to a class of resolved orbifolds that generalize [19]. Finally, and for us most significantly,
the constructions of [18–20] required considerable insights into the detailed properties of a
few examples. Our approach, building on the software package CYTools [23], amounts to a
general method that can be applied to the entire Kreuzer-Skarke database, and in principle
generate vast numbers of vacua. In this work we have presented only an initial harvest at
h2,1 ≤ 7, but extending our findings to larger h2,1 is a purely computational task.

1.1

Plan of the paper

The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2 we set our notation, explain how we
construct orientifolds, and review how we select quantized fluxes that yield small W0 ,
following [5]. We find classical solutions in which the F-terms of the complex structure
moduli and axiodilaton vanish, and these moduli are stabilized at weak string coupling and
large complex structure. At this level the Kähler moduli remain unstabilized. Then, in
§3, we explain how we identify orientifolds in which there are at least h1,1 nonperturbative
superpotential terms from Euclidean D3-branes or strong gauge dynamics on rigid prime
toric divisors. We further detail how we select geometries in which the Pfaffian prefactor

At this point we have proved that the effective superpotential for the Kähler moduli in
our ensemble of compactifications takes the form6

with W0  1. Here the DI are the h1,1 + 4 prime toric divisors of the Calabi-Yau threefold
hypersurface, and the ADI are constants, at least h1,1 of which are nonzero, according
to standard counting of fermion zero-modes. We parameterize the Kähler moduli by the
complexified volumes Ti of a basis {Di } of h1,1 prime toric divisors for which ADi 6= 0.
In order to find supersymmetric vacua, we must then find points in the Kähler moduli
space at which the F-terms for the Kähler moduli vanish. Such points take the form7

where the ellipsis denotes corrections that will be computed in §4. The Einstein-frame
volumes of the basis divisors are then large, because W0 is exponentially small.
Demonstrating that one or more points obeying (the appropriately corrected form of)
(1.3) are in fact inside the Kähler moduli space is the subject of §4 and §5. First, in §4,
we examine perturbative and nonperturbative corrections to the Kähler potential for the
Kähler moduli, and argue that because of the smallness of gs in our vacua, the leading
effects occur at string tree level, and result from worldsheet instantons wrapping small
curves. Then, in §5.2 we give an algorithm for finding vacua at large h1,1 . In order to
explicitly include the aforementioned worldsheet instanton effects, and more generally to
ensure control of the α0 expansion, we compute the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of a vast
set of curves in our examples (§5.3), and then determine the radius of convergence (§5.4).
In §6 we give the details of a few examples that result from applying this procedure
to the Kreuzer-Skarke list, for h2,1 ≤ 7. We discuss the implications of our findings in §7,
and we conclude, traditionally, in §8. Appendix A contains comments on the prospects for
an uplift to de Sitter space. A brief summary and discussion of our results appears in the
companion paper [24].

The ellipsis in (1.2) denotes subleading corrections: from Euclidean D(-1)-brane contributions to the
flux superpotential, and from further nonperturbative contributions to the superpotential for the Kähler
moduli, resulting in particular from Euclidean D3-branes on autochthonous divisors. These corrections
are shown to be negligible in §2.3 and §3.3, respectively.

Type IIB string theory compactified on X gives four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity
coupled to h2,1 (X) vector multiplets and h1,1 (X) + 1 hypermultiplets. Throughout this
paper we will consider orientifold projections of O3/O7 type, defined by holomorphic involutions I. The induced action of I on cohomology groups H p,q (X, Q) allows us to define
the even/odd eigenspaces H±p,q (X, Q), and we will make the additional restriction on I
2,1
that h+
(X) = h1,1
− (X) = 0, so that all the geometric moduli survive the projection. This
results in an effective N = 1 supergravity theory coupled to h2,1 (X) complex structure
moduli, the axiodilaton τ , and h1,1 (X) Kähler moduli, all in chiral multiplets. Their scalar
components can be parameterized by the z a and τ := C0 +ie−φ , and the Kähler parameters

theory. We postpone a discussion of the proper choice of holomorphic coordinates to §4.
Each of our compactifications contains some number NO7 of O7-planes wrapping mutually non-intersecting divisors DαO7 , α = 1, . . . , NO7 . We choose to cancel the D7-brane
charge tadpole of the O7-planes locally, by placing four D7-branes on top of each O7plane. This gives rise to seven-brane stacks with gauge algebras so(8). As usual, potential Freed-Witten anomalies on seven-branes [25] are cancelled by turning on half-integral

Orientifolds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces

The Calabi-Yau threefolds considered in this paper are hypersurfaces X in toric fourfolds V
whose toric fans Σ arise from triangulating four-dimensional reflexive polytopes ∆◦ ; all such
polytopes have been enumerated by Kreuzer and Skarke in [10]. Specifically, we consider
regular, star triangulations of ∆◦ in which points interior to facets are omitted, but each
point not interior to a facet is a vertex of a simplex in the triangulation. Such triangulations
define partial desingularizations of V in which a generic hypersurface X is smooth. Let
Σ(1) be the set of edges (one-dimensional cones) of Σ, and denote by {x1 , ..., xn } the
homogeneous coordinates associated with the edges: these are the generators of the Cox
ring. We have h1,1 (V ) = n − 4, and we define
DI := {xI = 0} ⊂ V .

(2.16)

The prime toric divisors DI generate H6 (V, Z), and over Z+ they generate the cone of
effective divisors on V . The inherited prime toric divisors of X,
DI := DI ∩ X ,

(2.17)

are effective divisors in H4 (X, Z). The DI generate all of H4 (X, Z) — i.e. the Picard group
of X is inherited from the Picard group of V , so that h1,1 (X) = h1,1 (V ) — if and only if ∆◦
has the property that every 2-face of ∆◦ that has interior points is dual to a 1-face of the
polar dual polytope ∆ that has no interior points. We call a model with this property ∆◦ 10

favorable. Even in cases that are not ∆◦ -favorable, the h1,1 (X) + 4 irreducible components
of the DI , which we will call the prime toric divisors of X, furnish an overcomplete set
of effective generators of H4 (X, Z). We note also that in general there can exist effective
divisor classes on X that cannot be written as non-negative linear combinations of the
prime toric divisors. Such divisor classes are called autochthonous.
A (partial) triangulation of the polar dual polytope ∆ defines a toric variety Ve whose
e is the mirror of X: in particular, h2,1 (X) = h1,1 (X).
e We call a
Calabi-Yau hypersurface X
model ∆-favorable if h2,1 (X) = h1,1 (Ve ), which occurs if and only if every 2-face of ∆ with
interior points is dual to a 1-face of ∆◦ without interior points.
Each orientifold model will be constructed using a holomorphic involution I : X → X
that can be defined via restricting an involution Ib : V → V to the hypersurface X, and
b X ) = X. The subgroup of the automorphism
tuning the hypersurface such that im(I|
group Aut(V, C) that is connected to the identity, Aut0 (V, C), is obtained by mapping the
homogeneous coordinates xI to general sections of OV (DI ) [30]. For simplicity we restrict to
involutions Ib ∈ Aut0 (X, C), as it is these that lead to h1,1

the homogeneous coordinates xI ,

As stated earlier, for simplicity we will restrict to involutions for which h+

large class of which can be found systematically [31]. More general orientifold models will
be discussed in [32].

Flux vacua

We now construct classical flux vacua with exponentially small W0 = h|Wflux |i, following [5].
We make use of the form F = Fpoly + Finst of the prepotential near LCS,9 which was
explained below (2.3), and write
(pert)

Wflux = Wflux

(2.19)

where the first term is obtained by approximating Fa by ∂za Fpoly , and the second term is
the correction to this approximation from Finst . We now seek to solve

of these curves, Nq̃1 and Nq̃2 — the string coupling gs = 1/Im(τ ) is polynomially small,
while the flux superpotential is exponentially small.
In obtaining (2.26) and (2.27) we have consistently omitted the effects of other worldsheet instantons, by virtue of the condition (f) that we imposed above on the pair (q̃1 , q̃2 ).
We have also omitted the effects of Euclidean D(-1)-branes, which from (2.12) give contributions to the superpotential of order exp(−2π/gs ). Let us now explain why this is justified.
The worldsheet instanton terms in (2.24) have actions Si = 2πq̃i · p/gs for i = 1, 2, and in
our flux vacua one has e−Si ∼ W0 . In terms of the parameter

The conditions for a perturbatively flat vacuum in (2.3) are Diophantine in nature,
and so are difficult to solve in general. Nevertheless, in practice we have been able to find
solutions to the constraints when h2,1 is relatively small.

Nonperturbative superpotential

3.1

Rigid divisors

A Euclidean D3-brane (ED3) wrapped on an effective divisor is half-BPS and can thus
contribute to the superpotential provided the only exact fermion zero-modes are the two
universal modes, i.e. the goldstini associated to the breaking of half the supercharges. In
the absence of worldvolume flux and bulk three-form flux, the zero-modes take values in
the cohomology groups H±• (D, OD ), and a superpotential term is therefore generated if D
is smooth and
h•+ (D) = (1, 0, 0) , and h•− (D) = (0, 0, 0) .
(3.1)
We call a divisor D that satisfies (3.1) a rigid divisor.10
Equivalently, one can consider the dual F-theory compactification on an elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold πE : Y4 → B3 , where B3 ≃ X/I is the base manifold of the
elliptic fibration. A Euclidean D3-brane on a divisor D uplifts to a Euclidean M5-brane
b ⊂ Y4 . The fermion zero-modes take values in H • (D,
b O b ),
wrapped on a vertical divisor D

so the F-theory version of the rigidity condition (3.1) is
b O b ) = (1, 0, 0, 0) .
h• (D,
D

(3.2)

b that satisfies (3.2) is likewise called a rigid divisor, and a smooth rigid divisor
A divisor D
b contributes to the superpotential [37]. In this paper it will suffice to study (3.1) and (3.2)
D
for prime toric divisors of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, for which smoothness is guaranteed.11
We now turn our attention to non-abelian gauge theories on seven-branes. In the
Calabi-Yau orientifolds considered in this paper, most O7-planes wrap rigid divisors, and
as explained in §2.1, we cancel the D7-brane tadpole locally by placing four D7-branes
on each O7-plane. As a result, for each so(8) stack on a rigid divisor D we obtain pure
N = 1 so(8) super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, whose holomorphic gauge coupling is given
by TD /4π at high energy. At low energies the gauginos of pure N = 1 SYM condense and
generate a nonperturbative superpotential term AD (z, τ )e−2πTD /cD .
In some of our compactifications, a small subset of the O7-planes wrap divisors DN
that have normal bundle deformations, with h• (DN ) = (1, 0, 1) or, in rare cases, h• (DN ) =
(1, 0, 2). As the volume of DN is typically many times larger than that of the h1,1 small10

More generally, worldvolume flux and bulk three-form flux will generically lift the zero-modes associated with h2± (D, OD ) and h1− (D, OD ) [34–36], but we will not rely on such lifting.
11
At a generic point in the complex structure moduli space of a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold X, the
prime toric divisors DI are smooth, because their strata are inherited from the strata of X [38–40].

est rigid prime toric divisors, stabilization of the Kähler moduli does not require, and is
negligibly affected by, potential gaugino condensation in the so(8) stack on DN , which can
occur if fluxes lift all the normal bundle deformations.
Indeed, we expect that normal bundle deformations of the seven-branes on DN are
stabilized by background three-form fluxes. To rigidify a D7-brane on a divisor D one can
turn on the worldvolume flux F2 = [C] − [C 0 ] [34] on the D7-brane, where C ⊂ D is a
rigid holomorphic curve and C 0 is its orientifold image. This procedure cannot be applied
to rigidify the so(8) stack, because every holomorphic curve C in an O7-plane is pointwise
invariant under the orientifold action, and hence [C] = [C 0 ]. However, in a nontrivial H3
background, where locally we can write H3 = dB2 , upon displacing a D7-brane away
from an O7-plane on DN , the B2 field induced on the displaced D7-brane grows, which
eventually leads to D7-brane monodromies [41–44]. As a result, the displaced D7-brane
feels a monodromy potential

VD7 = 8

The minimum of this potential lies at the so(8) stack configuration, where B2 = 0:
the O7-plane is a fixed locus of the orientifold involution I, and the orientifold acts as
B2 (x) 7→ −B2 (I(x)). The displacement of the D7-brane also induces D3-brane charge on
its worldvolume, and thus by conservation of D3-brane charge the bulk D3-brane charge
density from fluxes, and their energy density, gets reduced within the region swept out by
the moving D7-brane. The overall potential is positive semi-definite, and vanishes if and
only if the induced ı∗DN B2 happens to be self-dual on DN [42, 44].12 In this paper we will
not check this condition explicitly, but note that the anti-self dual part generically does
not vanish, and seven-branes should be stabilized automatically. Moreover, even if they
do turn out to be unstabilized at this level, they either stay exact moduli after inclusion
of all perturbative and non-perturbative corrections — which seems implausible but would
in any case not endanger the existence of our vacua — or they receive a potential from
those corrections. In the latter case, due to the orientifold plane boundary conditions, the
potential would have to be minimized or maximized in the so(8) configuration, and thus
the D7-branes would be stabilized there by virtue of the unbroken supersymmetry.13
Next, let us remark that the superpotential terms from gaugino condensation on confin12

This is related to the non-generic situations described in [36] in which the normal bundle deformations
of a Euclidean D3-brane do not get lifted by fluxes.

In our AdS vacua the potential could have a maximum with negative mass2 above the BreitenlohnerFreedman (BF) bound.

15

ing seven-brane gauge theories have a simple M/F-theory description, again described by a
Euclidean M5-brane. Consider a smooth F-theory uplift ∆E of an irreducible discriminant
locus ∆E of the elliptic fibration. We assume that a gauge group G is engineered on ∆E , and
for simplicity we assume that there is no curve γ in ∆E where the gauge group G is enhanced
to a larger group G0 . Then, π −1 (∆E ) = ∆E is topologically equivalent to a union of P1 ’s
(corresponding to the Dynkin nodes of G) times ∆E . It follows that the fermion zero-modes
of an M5-brane wrapped on ∆E are counted by h• (∆E , O∆E ) = c2 (G)h• (P1 × ∆E , OP1 ×∆E ).
For a rigid ∆E , a Euclidean M5-brane wrapped on a Dynkin node P1 × D has the right
number of zero-modes to contribute to the superpotential. Under the projection πE , the
Dynkin node maps to a fractional divisor class [∆E ]/c2 (G). Hence, we conclude again
that an so(8) stack on a rigid divisor D generates a nonperturbative superpotential term
AD (z, τ )e−2πTD /6 .
Finally, we would like to briefly comment on the matching between the zero-mode
counting in the type IIB picture and the dual M/F-theory picture. Consider a blowdown
of the elliptic fibration πE0 : Y40 → B3 such that the elliptic fiber, E, develops singularities
at the discriminant locus. We note that odd-dimensional cycles of E can be viewed as
orientifold-odd and even-dimensional cycles of E as orientifold-even, due to the −1 ∈
SL(2, Z) monodromy picked up under encircling an so(8) stack. To compute the Hodge

Pfaffian prefactors

The Pfaffian prefactor AD (z, τ ) of a nonperturbative superpotential term is related to the

uli space. Along such D, the corresponding nonperturbative superpotential term no longer
contributes to the potential for the Kähler moduli, while in the immediate neighborhood
of D the contribution is suppressed; either case could impact the vacuum structure.
The stabilization of the complex structure moduli and axiodilaton by fluxes leads to
expectation values hzi, hτ i, and the generic situation is that these expectation values do
not lie on D, or exponentially near D. If we now define

Avac
D := AD hzi, hτ i ,

(3.5)

then the expectation values Avac
D are simply (unknown) complex numbers, and the vacuum
configuration for the Kähler moduli could be expressed in terms of their values.
Even so, one could worry that a conspiracy might cause some of the Avac
D to be exponentially small in the classical flux vacua of §2.3 that yield W0  1. This would jeopardize
a search for AdS vacua.16 For the avoidance of doubt, we will ensure that zeros of the
Pfaffian cannot arise in our examples, by selecting compactifications in which the Pfaffians
of all leading rigid prime toric divisors are pure numbers, i.e. sections of the trivial line
bundle on moduli space. Let us now explain how this can be achieved.

priori unknown complex numbers. We note that the above expansion can be reinterpreted
via mirror symmetry as a poly-instanton expansion including Euclidean D2-branes and
worldsheet instantons in a type IIA O6 orientifold.
16

We are not aware of any reasoning that predicts that such a conspiracy should actually occur in
string theory, but we can predict that the solutions presented here would be criticized on this basis if the
possibility were not strictly excluded.
(k)
17
In general, the expansion of the AD (z) around LCS may contain terms that are polynomial in the
z a , which are not displayed in (3.6). Such terms are absent along perturbatively flat vacua due to the
unbroken discrete shift symmetry preserved by the fluxes of (2.21) [5].

AD (z, τ ) = AD

(3.7)

The type IIB zero-mode counting — i.e., the rigidity condition imposed on D in §3.1 —
implies that AD (z, τ ) does not vanish identically. However, at this stage one cannot exclude
(0,0)
that AD = 0.18 In such a case, Avac
D would be extremely small, as our flux vacua occur
at weak string coupling and near LCS.
To avoid this outcome, we will ensure that the following three relations hold:
(a) AD (z, τ ) is not identically zero;
(j,k)

= 0 ∀j > 0 ,

(j,k)

= 0 ∀k > 0 ,

(b) AD
(c) AD

(0,0)

which together imply that AD 6= 0. In sum, by enforcing (a), (b), and (c) we guarantee
that Avac
D is not systematically suppressed near weak coupling and LCS.
b must be rigid.
In fact we have already imposed condition (a), by insisting that D
(k)
To impose (b), we recall from standard zero-mode counting that the AD (z) are nonzero
for gauge bundles F ∈ H−1,1 (D, Z) that do not descend via restriction from nontrivial

classes in H 2 (X, Z). In particular, if h−
(D) = 0 then only AD (z) is non-vanishing, and
19
thus h1,1
− (D) = 0 implies condition (b).
(0)
Finally, to impose (c), we will arrange that AD (z) is actually independent of z. We
are aware of two mechanisms for ensuring this, which we now discuss in turn.
3.2.2

Pure rigid divisors

In [3] it was shown that the partition function of the worldvolume theory of an M5-brane
b is an elliptic theta function of the complex structure moduli of
wrapping a divisor D
b R)/H 3 (D,
b Z). As the complex structure moduli
the intermediate Jacobian J := H 3 (D,
of J depend on the complex structure moduli of Y4 , in principle by computing J one
b = 0, then the corresponding M5-brane
can determine AD (z, τ ). In particular, if h2,1 (D)

This situation would be mirror dual to a single Euclidean D2-brane on a special Lagrangian three-cycle

Note that condition (b) is not actually necessary for ensuring that AD 6= 0: a rigid O(1) Euclidean

(0)
D3-brane has Pfaffian AD (z) which, via zero-mode counting, is not identically zero. If AD (z) is also

z-independent then it already follows that AD 6= 0, even if h1,1

from a pure rigid divisor D
To impose the condition of pure rigidity, the first step is to compute the dimension
b in an elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfold. For each Calabi-Yau

Calabi-Yau fourfold, by first obtaining the base B3 := X/I as a hypersurface in V /I,

However, a condition that can be checked directly in the type IIB compactification
implies (c) but not (b), as we now explain. Though we will not make use of it here, in
future model-building this alternative may be useful, as the uplift to F-theory is not always
easy to analyze.
One can forbid z-dependence of the Pfaffian by imposing that D has no complex structure deformations: in terms of the tangent bundle TD of D, one requires that h1 (TD ) = 0.
In this case, the complex structure of D is necessarily independent of the bulk complex
structure moduli z, and thus the partition function of the Euclidean D3-brane worldvolume
theory cannot depend on z. We call a divisor D obeying h1 (TD ) = 0 inflexible.
The constraint h1 (TD ) = 0 is satisfied by a considerable majority of prime toric divisors
D in Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces X with h1,1 (X)  1. At large h1,1 (X) almost all
prime toric divisors of X arise from points interior to 1-faces and 2-faces of the reflexive
polytope ∆◦ . It is straightforward to see that divisors from points interior to 2-faces are
toric surfaces themselves, and thus trivially satisfy h1 (TD ) = 0. In general, divisors from
points interior to 1-faces are P1 -fibrations over curves of genus g, where g is determined
by the number of points interior to the dual 2-face in the dual polytope ∆. As explained
in §2.2, for convenience we impose ∆-favorability in our models, and in particular we have
g = 0 for all 1-face divisors. Because P1 fibrations over P1 are likewise toric, we again
find h1 (TD ) = 0 for all divisors from points interior to 1-faces. The only divisors that
need to be checked case by case are those arising from vertices of ∆◦ . Their complex
structure deformations are inherited from those of X, i.e. h1 (TD ) = h1 (TX |D ), so all one
needs to do is inspect the anti-canonical polynomial f along D. The surviving monomials
correspond to the points of the facet of ∆ dual to the vertex, and rigidity of D is in one-toone correspondence with absence of interior points in the facet. After setting to zero the
toric coordinate associated to D one can still use the action of an algebraic torus (C∗ )3 to
gauge fix three coefficients of f |D , and finally use the freedom of overall rescaling of f |D .
Thus, h1 (TD ) = 0 if and only if there are exactly four points in the dual facet, i.e. if and
only if the facet is a simplex.
In summary, prime toric divisors Df corresponding to points interior to 2-faces f of
◦
∆ are always rigid and inflexible, and in ∆-favorable models, prime toric divisors De
corresponding to points interior to 1-faces e are likewise always rigid and inflexible. A
prime toric divisor Dv corresponding to a vertex v is inflexible if and only the dual facet is
a simplex, and is rigid if and only if the dual facet has no interior points. Equipped with
these results, we are able to check the condition h1 (TD ) = 0 in our models.

Pfaffian numbers
(0,0)

The complex numbers22 ADI ≡ ADI associated to pure rigid prime toric divisors DI are
the only unknowns in the leading data of the effective supergravity theories studied in this
paper. A few comments are in order regarding their properties.
Although in all our models we have proved that the ADI are numbers, one could worry
that one or more of them is actually the number 0, which after all is a famous section of
the trivial line bundle.23 We have excluded the main physical reasons for such a zero —
namely, integrals over moduli space, extra fermion zero modes, and cancellations [53–55] —
and so the ADI are generically nonzero by the usual standards of instanton calculus. Even
so, computing their values directly, perhaps along the lines of [56,57], would be worthwhile.
Moreover, one might wonder whether the ADI could be hierarchical, because similar
prefactors are often related to BPS state counts, which can in principle involve large numbers. However, changing the ADI leads to relative corrections in the vevs of the Kähler
moduli of order log(ADI )/ log(W0 ). In our examples, W0−1 far exceeds any number that
could reasonably appear in a BPS state count at low degrees, and so we expect our approximation to be excellent. Even so, after finding supersymmetric vacua for the reference
value ADI = 1 ∀I, we have repeated our analysis with ADI ∈ {10−4 , 104 }, and recovered
the existence of vacua.
Let us further point out that because the ADI remain unchanged as we select fluxes to
explore vacua with smaller and smaller W0 , there is no possibility of a conspiracy in which
the ADI become ill-behaved as W0 → 0 and thus destroy the vacuum structure.24
Finally, we remark that thus far we have ensured that the ADI do not depend on the
closed string moduli and the seven-brane moduli. However, in some of our compactifications, mobile D3-branes will be present, and all of the ADI do necessarily depend on all the
D3-brane position moduli. As a D3-brane approaches a rigid divisor DI , the corresponding
nonperturbative superpotential term tends to zero: linearly in the separation for Euclidean
D3-branes, and with fractional power c−1
DI for gaugino condensation [58–62]. Thus, the Fflat configuration for the D3-brane position moduli has the D3-branes stabilized away from
22

Note that as we can neglect Euclidean D3-brane corrections to the Kähler potential, nothing is lost
by using the axion shift symmetries Ti → Ti + δTi with δTi ∈ iR to absorb the complex phases in h1,1
Pfaffian numbers, but in some examples we find h1,1 + 1, h1,1 + 2, or h1,1 + 3 leading contributions, and
in such cases there are one, two, or three phases remaining, respectively.
23
See e.g. [51, 52].
24
Likewise, the mass of the perturbatively-flat direction z = pτ is comparable to the masses of the Kähler
moduli [5], and if some of the ADI were to vary along z = pτ , the stabilization of the perturbatively-flat
direction and of the Kähler moduli would be entangled. Because the ADI are constant this possibility
does not arise in our examples.

the vanishing loci ADI = 0 [63]. In the following it will be understood that the Pfaffians
ADI are evaluated at the F-flat minimum for the D3-brane moduli.25

3.3

Autochthonous divisors

The most obvious corrections to the superpotential of (1.1) come from multi-instantons
or, potentially, from Euclidean D3-branes wrapped on divisors that can be written as nonnegative linear combinations of two or more prime toric divisors. At points in moduli space
where the one-instanton and gaugino condensation terms that we have already incorporated
in (1.1) are small, such corrections are parametrically sub-leading.
However, as we now explain, another class of Euclidean D3-brane contributions deserves
a more detailed analysis: as recalled in §2.2, a Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface X in a
toric variety V inherits effective divisors D from divisors D of V via intersection with X,
i.e. D = D ∩X. Effective divisors on X that are not inherited are termed autochthonous.26
Methods for identifying the classes of autochthonous divisor will be presented elsewhere
[65]. For the present work, it suffices to remark that computing all effective divisor classes
in a Calabi-Yau threefold with large h1,1 is not currently feasible, and so we will study
the nonperturbative superpotential terms that result from Euclidean D3-branes that wrap
inherited divisors, which are very easy to identify from toric data.
One might then ask whether rigid autochthonous divisors could support Euclidean D3brane superpotential terms that alter the vacuum structure that we will compute herein
based on inherited divisors. Fortunately, a peculiarity of the KKLT construction obviates
computing all autochthonous contributions. To see this, we consider a toy example, in
which X is a Calabi-Yau orientifold, D1 and D2 are inherited prime toric divisors on X, and
2D1 −D2 is an autochthonous — and hence, by definition, effective, and thus also calibrated
— divisor. If we find a point in the Kähler cone KX where vol(D1 ) = vol(D2 ) ≡ T , then
vol(2D1 − D2 ) = T as well, and a Euclidean D3-brane wrapping vol(2D1 − D2 ) makes at
most a contribution comparable to those of the effective divisors, not parametrically larger.
Now we recall that any divisor, including an autochthonous one, is always expressible in
R
Note that if 21 X H3 ∧ F3 ∈ 21 Z then one needs to introduce a ‘half’ D3-brane stuck either on one of
the seven-brane stacks or on one of the O3-planes. When this is necessary, we will place the half D3-brane
on a seven-brane stack on a divisor D that is not relevant for Kähler moduli stabilization, thus adding a
chiral multiplet (or a half-hypermultiplet if D = K3) in the 8 of SO(8) and two neutral chiral multiplets
(a hypermultiplet if D = K3) parameterizing the position of the half D3-brane along the seven-branes:
see e.g. [64].
26
Through the inclusion of X in V , an autochthonous divisor DA on X corresponds to an effective
subvariety of complex dimension two in V , but unlike an inherited effective divisor, this subvariety is not
the intersection D ∩ X for any effective divisor D on V .
25

22

terms of an integer (but not necessarily positive integer) linear combination of prime toric
divisors. Moreover, in the vacua that we will find below, the (Einstein frame) volumes
of a subset of h1,1 (X) prime toric divisors take integer values, up to an overall factor
log(W0−1 )/2π: those hosting so(8) stacks of seven-branes have volumes c2 (so(8)) = 6 times
larger than those hosting Euclidean D3-branes. If, at this point in moduli space, the other
four prime toric divisors also have integer volumes, then in fact all divisors have integer
volumes, again up to an overall factor. In such a case, just as in the toy example, the
volume of an autochthonous divisor in the vacuum is k × log(W0−1 )/2π, with k ∈ Z. As the
Calabi-Yau threefold is smooth inside the Kähler cone we have k > 0. Euclidean D3-branes
on autochthonous divisors with k > 1 are exponentially negligible. Morevoer, it is easy to
show that neglecting Euclidean D3-branes on autochthonous divisors with k = 1 produces
an O(1) error in the vevs of the Kähler moduli. As these are of order log(W0−1 )  1,
omitting k = 1 autochthonous divisors produces an error only at subleading order in
log(W0−1 )−1  1.
This very general argument shows that autochthonous divisors can never make parametrically large contributions to the superpotential in our vacua. However, we have also
constructed a class of autochthonous divisors that can be found from polytope data [65]:
all such divisors turn out to be very large in our examples, no less than 100 times larger
than the leading prime toric divisors, and so can be completely neglected.

Kähler potential and Kähler coordinates

In the preceding sections, we have detailed a process for constructing flux compactifications
on Calabi-Yau orientifolds in which the superpotential takes the form (1.1), with at least
h1,1 nonperturbative superpotential terms, all with constant Pfaffians. We will call such a
configuration a compactification with KKLT superpotential.
A nontrivial question is whether such a compactification actually admits a supersymmetric AdS4 vacuum: specifically, does there exist a point in the Kähler moduli space of X
where the F-terms of all h1,1 Kähler moduli vanish and the α0 expansion is well-controlled?
This question hinges on the form of the Kähler potential KK,τ for the Kähler moduli Ti
and the axiodilaton τ , to which we now turn.
At tree level we have that

is the string-frame volume of the Calabi-Yau threefold X, cf. (2.13), and Ti are the holomorphic Kähler coordinates. Here, e−2φ Vst is simply the four-dimensional dilaton obtained
by dimensionally reducing the ten-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert term in string frame, and
eφ ≡ gs .
The Kähler potential KK,τ receives perturbative and nonperturbative corrections in the
0
α and gs expansions. In particular, nonperturbative corrections arise from Euclidean D(1)-branes; worldsheet instantons, and more generally Euclidean (p, q) strings, wrapped on
two-cycles; Euclidean D3-branes wrapped on four-cycles; and Euclidean (p, q) fivebranes
wrapped on the Calabi-Yau threefold X. We can write

where cτ > 1 is a model-dependent number defined in (2.29) that is determined by the

(4.3) and (4.4). However, as Einstein frame four-cycle volumes will turn out to also scale
27

For a related discussion of the perturbative expansion in gs and α0 , see [66].

as log W0−1 /2π, the string frame four-cycle volumes do not become large in the limit of
small W0 . Thus the α0 expansion of V [0] is not in general well-approximated by the lowestorder term Vst , and likewise for Re(Ti ). This, however, does not pose an insurmountable
problem, as we now explain.
The perturbative contributions to V [0] come from α0 corrections to the ten-dimensional

where ... stands for terms with more than two derivatives in the metric, dilaton and twoform. Corrections to the effective action from brane sources (i.e. open strings) and from the
R-R sector are dressed by a relative suppression factor of gs , so these effects can contribute
only to V [k] (t, z) with k ≥ 1. To see this one recalls that the Kähler potential at closed
string tree level can be computed from a worldsheet CFT two-point function on the sphere,
−χ(S 2 )
which is dressed by gs
= gs−2 , while orientifolding introduces open strings whose tree
level contribution to the Kähler potential comes from a disk amplitude, dressed by a factor
−χ(disk)
gs
= gs−1 : see e.g. [59, 67, 68]. Equivalently, one recovers this from the fact that both
D-brane and O-plane tensions in string frame are proportional to gs−1 . As usual, string
loop corrections are even more suppressed, as they come from torus, annulus, Klein bottle
and Möbius strip amplitudes, all of which have χ = 0.
In our solutions the dilaton is constant, ∂φ = 0, so no correction proportional to ∂φ
contributes to the Kähler potential. Finally, in our solutions we also have that [28]

In conclusion, at O(gs ) we are left with pure curvature corrections, as the effect of
fluxes and orientifolding (open strings) are invisible at this order. Thus, all sources of
breaking from N = 2 to N = 1 supersymmetry contribute only to V [k] with k ≥ 1, and
we can therefore accurately compute the curvature corrections assuming eight unbroken
supercharges! In fact, these corrections are known exactly, at least in principle, by virtue of
mirror symmetry. A quick way to get to the result is to compare with the mirror dual type

The perturbative expansion of V [0] consists only of the classical term, namely Vst , and the
famous BBHL correction [12] at order α03 . However, there are infinitely many instanton
corrections whose amplitudes are given by the genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of
X [77, 78], which can be computed using mirror symmetry [13, 79–82]. A comment is in
order regarding the range of validity of (4.11). It is tempting to continue the expressions
V [0] and Ti through flop transitions between topologically distinct phases. At the transition
locus an effective curve C shrinks to zero volume and one has to distinguish between two
28

Note that the part of the N = 1 Kähler potential for the Kähler moduli that is inherited from the
N = 2 parent theory is related to the hyper-Kähler potential of the hypermultiplet sector of type IIB on X,
which via the c-map is related to the Kähler potential for the vector multiplets of type IIA on X [71–73].
This is of course consistent with (4.9).
29
The appropriate Z-linear combination of periods is straightforward to identify by matching the polynomial corrections of the periods at LCS with the α0 -corrected action [74–76] for Euclidean D3-branes
wrapped on the basis divisors at large volume.
30
Strictly speaking the formula (4.11) for Ti holds only if the basis divisors can host Euclidean D3-branes
with vanishing gauge-invariant worldvolume flux in our B2 field background, i.e. if c1 (Di )/2 − ı∗Di B2 is
integer-valued for all i. In our examples we have checked that this is true.

emerging at zero curve volume t. Thus, upon continuing to negative t one naı̈vely picks
up a non-vanishing imaginary part, which is puzzling because the Ti were constructed to
give the real parts of gs Ti . However, no matter how small the string coupling gs is, before
the point t = 0 is reached an infinite tower of instanton corrections from Euclidean (p, q)strings with arbitrary (p, q) become unsuppressed, invalidating (4.11).31 As an aside, one
often finds that h1,1
− (D) of a rigid divisor D jumps across flop transitions of the above type.
This suggests that the dilaton dependence of the Pfaffian AD (z, τ ) can likewise jump. We
speculate that upon interpolating from one phase to the next, one needs to resum Euclidean
(p, q) string corrections to the definition of the Kähler coordinates, along the lines of [83],
in such a way that the Euclidean D(-1)-brane corrections to (4.11) are modified, and such
that eK/2 |AD (τ, z)e−2πTD | can be evaluated in either phase, with agreement at the flop
transition locus.32 In any event, our analysis does not depend on the resolution of this
puzzle.
Second, if C does intersect an O7-plane transversely in a single point, or is contained
R
in the O7-plane with intersection number −1, one has C B2 = 12 , and contributions from
wrapped (p, q)-strings are parametrically suppressed at small gs except for (p, q) = (1, 0),
i.e. worldsheet instantons. Indeed, in this case there are no branch cuts,33

so one can continue (4.11) to negative t. Moreover, such transitions make sense physically: the divisor wrapped by the O7-plane intersecting C undergoes a blow-up/blowdown transition and an O3-plane gets absorbed/emitted in a way that preserves D3-brane
31

One should be able to likewise determine these from N = 2 data, i.e. the hyper-Kähler potential of
the hypermultiplet sector [71], because fluxes remain dilute and, by assumption, orientifold planes do not
intersect C, but we will not do so here.
32
Alternatively, one might conclude that the N = 1 quasi-moduli space actually ends at the flop
transition locus, fracturing the Calabi-Yau moduli space into disconnected components. This appears
unlikely to us, because it certainly does not occur with N = 2 supersymmetry, and the N = 2 → N = 1
supersymmetry breaking from fluxes and O-planes becomes arbitrarily weak in the conifold region in the
limit that the curve shrinks.

expression of the form (4.11), but with all geometric quantities replaced by those of the
flopped phase, as needed for consistency. This follows immediately from the polylogarithm

and likewise for Li3 (−e−2πt ), in beautiful agreement with the well-known transformation
properties of χ(Di ) and κijk under flop transitions. In accordance with the above, we have
not found examples where h1,1
− (D) of a rigid divisor jumps across a flop transition of this
type.
Let us pause to stress an important point. Suppose we are faced with a series of
corrections in the α0 expansion, and we seek to know whether their contributions to the
Kähler potential ruin the vacuum structure that was computed at leading order. If the
corrections have unknown coefficients, then a conservative requirement is that all effective
curves should have large volumes in string units: a curve of volume, say, 2`2s might be
problematic, and it might not. But when we can actually compute the coefficients of the
leading series of corrections, a weaker — and at the same time, much more precise —
condition suffices: the curve volumes need only lie within the radius of convergence of the
series. Because the leading corrections in (4.11) are determined by GV invariants, which
we can compute (see §5.3), we will be able to ensure control of the α0 expansion in this
sharper manner: see §5.4.

4.2

Corrections beyond string tree level

The leading additional correction to (4.11), which is suppressed by a further power of
the string coupling, comes from the backreaction of three-form fluxes F3 and H3 , and its
flux
, as explained above. Similarly, the corrections from
magnitude is proportional to gs−1 ND3
D-brane sources are expected to be of order gs−1 Q where Q is the corresponding (locally
uncancelled) brane charge. As seven-brane charges are cancelled locally in our vacua,
the only relevant corrections come from fluxes and D3-branes, and from the induced D3brane charge on seven-branes and O3-planes, so the leading correction induced by fluxes
is suppressed in comparison to the tree level result by a factor [28, 86]
gN =1 := gs |ND3 | .

become nontrivial constraints nevertheless, and we will carefully check them.
X,ωi
The fact that the control parameters gs and gN
=1 are very small in our examples
provides strong evidence that our vacua are well-controlled. One could check this more
explicitly by computing the leading string loop corrections to the Kähler potential. In
carrying out such a computation — which is beyond the scope of this work — special
attention should be paid to corrections from curves C ∼
= P1 that are close to undergoing a
flop transition, and thus have small volumes in string units. As explained in the previous
section, such curves come in two different classes.
In the first class, C does not intersect any seven-branes. In the limit that such a C
shrinks to a point, the local neighborhood of the singular geometry contains no brane
sources. For this reason, and because fluxes are negligible at short distances, the breaking
of supersymmetry from N = 2 to N = 1 becomes arbitrarily weak in the limit of vanishing
curve volume. Thus, corrections to the Kähler potential coming from a small curve of this
type are simply inherited from the hypermultiplet moduli space metric of the N = 2 parent
theory. Such corrections are captured by (4.11) at string tree level, while the corrections
beyond string tree level are known [72, 83, 87, 88] and can be shown to be negligible in our
examples.
In the second class, a stack of seven-branes intersects the shrinking curve C. Cancellation of Freed-Witten anomalies in such a background requires the existence of a discrete
34

29

B-field, and the presence of this B-field ensures that the limit of vanishing curve volume is
a non-singular locus in the N = 2 moduli space. Thus, there are no important corrections
to the Kähler potential at string tree level. One easily shows that this result extends to all
orders in gs in the parent N = 2 Calabi-Yau compactification.
We conclude that for both classes of curves, the string loop corrections to the Kähler
potential that are inherited from the N = 2 parent theory can be neglected in our examples,
to all orders in gs . It remains to consider genuine N = 1 corrections to the Kähler potential
for curves C that intersect seven-branes. If such corrections were to diverge at small curve
volume, then the vacuum structure that we have described thus far would be endangered.
However, such a divergence would be quite remarkable: as discussed in the previous section,
transitioning through the locus of vanishing curve volume appears to make perfect sense
even in the N = 1 theory with O-planes and D-branes [19, 85], while divergent corrections
at small curve volume would remove the transition locus to infinite distance in moduli
space. Nevertheless, an actual proof of the absence of such divergent corrections, say at
order gs0 , would be desirable. We leave this interesting task for future work.

Computational methods

Having determined the leading data of the effective N = 1 supergravity in our ensemble
of compactifications, we now discuss the search for supersymmetric vacua therein.

5.1

Iterative solution

We have just established that in our vacua, where gs  1 but string-frame volumes are of
order unity, the Kähler potential for the holomorphic Kähler moduli Ti is determined by
the k = 0 terms of (4.3), which are given in (4.11), and which incorporates perturbative
and worldsheet instanton corrections in the α0 expansion, at string tree level. In particular,
the dependence of V [0] on Re(Ti ) is not as simple as in (4.1), which includes only the leading
term in both the gs and α0 expansions.
Fortunately, the vacuum conditions that arise from the superpotential of (1.1) are rather
insensitive to the precise form of V [0] (Re T ), and we will be able to iteratively incorporate
the small effects of the α0 corrections in (4.11). This is seen as follows. We have the

that vanishes in the limit W0 → 0, and is of order a few percent in our examples. It
is straightforward to perturb (5.1) by a further commensurate instanton, e.g. from an
autochthonous divisor (cf. §3.3) or another prime toric divisor, to see that the vevs of the
Ti get perturbed by at most an O(1) factor that likewise becomes negligible for small W0 .
In the above argument we have imagined following a discrete series of flux vacua leading
i
to smaller W0 , and we have implicitly assumed that there is no conspiracy that causes 2Vt [0]
i
to scale as log(W0−1 ) in the limit W0 → 0. This is well-justified: the values 2Vt [0] in a series
of vacua are independent of the choice of background fluxes, except through the effects
of the (computable) O(1) changes in the coefficients cτ defined in (2.29). We expect such
changes in cτ to be independent of the scaling of W0 along a series of vacua, and this is
indeed borne out in our examples.
We conclude that a full solution of the F-flatness conditions (5.1) should exist near

Note that the axion vevs Im(Ti ) are determined by the complex phases of the Ai and thus cannot be

Even so, we would much prefer to prove the existence of a vacuum — and to compute the
vacuum energy and the moduli masses — by means of a reliable computation of the Kähler
potential near such a point. For this reason, we will select vacua at points where we can
compute the worldsheet instanton corrections to V [0] and Re(Ti ) rather systematically, and
thus accurately compute the Kähler potential: see §5.4.

(5.7)

We now turn to finding solutions of this form and verifying that they lie in a region of
parametric control, where the assumptions that led to (5.7) are justified a posteriori.
As a first step, we consider solving (5.7) using the tree-level expression Ti → g1s 12 κijk tj tk
of (4.1). When h1,1  1, the Kähler cone KX typically has exponentially many subcones,
or chambers: for example, flopping a suitable curve in X leads one to a new chamber, where
new possibilities for flops may arise.37 Given a compactification with KKLT superpotential,
a randomly chosen triangulation of ∆◦ will typically correspond to a chamber of KX in
which there does not exist a supersymmetric AdS4 vacuum. We will therefore need to
search through the secondary fan to find a triangulation in which such a vacuum does
exist. Because the number of chambers is exponentially large at large h1,1 , a brute force
search would be ineffective.
We will now describe an effective algorithm for finding points in the extended Kähler
cone KX where the basis divisors have the desired values. First, as both log(W0 ) and gs
enter only as overall factors in the F-term equation (5.7), we may instead solve the equation
1
κ tj tk = ci , which is independent of the choice of fluxes. Second, we will illustrate the
2 ijk
algorithm in a simplified case in which all dual Coxeter numbers ci are set to one, but the
generalization is immediate.
We wish to find a point in the extended Kähler cone where a basis set of h1,1 linearly
independent prime toric divisors Di , i = 1, . . . , h1,1 , have unit volumes, while the remaining
four divisors have larger (or equal) volumes. The first challenge is to identify choices of
36

One further possible conspiracy is that quantum effects might become strong enough to ‘cap off’
moduli space before a candidate point is reached. While conceivable, we find it hard to envision a scenario
where no nearby solution with similar properties would exist.

See e.g. [89] for a recent exploration at large h1,1 .

basis divisors with the property that once their volumes are set to unity, the volumes of
the remaining four divisors are strictly positive. This is equivalent to requiring that the
constant vector τ? = (1, . . . , 1) is contained in the dual of the cone of effective divisors,
E(X)◦ . The number of possible basis choices — chosen from subsets of h1,1 prime toric
divisors that all contribute to the superpotential — is finite, and is often small enough to
allow for a brute force search.
Once an appropriate basis is identified, the next task is to find the Kähler parameters t?
that result in unit divisor volumes τ? . One might be tempted to parameterize the extended
Kähler cone by the divisor volumes τ i and aim to prove that it contains τ? . However, to the
best of our knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to construct the corresponding
phase of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface given only τ i . In contrast, t? naturally corresponds
to a point in the secondary fan, from which one can obtain a fine, regular, star triangulation
(FRST), defining a toric fan and a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
We start by picking a random point hinit in the subset of the secondary fan of FRSTs,
which we denote by G. Such a point is naturally associated to a point in the extended
Kähler cone, tinit , with basis divisor volumes τinit . Consider any point on the straight line
between τinit and τ? ,
τα = (1 − α)τinit + ατ?
(5.8)
parameterized by 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. Since E ◦ (X) is convex, τinit ∈ E(X)◦ and τ? ∈ E(X)◦ implies
that τα ∈ E(X)◦ . Our strategy is to start from a randomly chosen τinit and move towards
τ? on this line.38
The corresponding path between tinit and t? is not straight, since the divisor volumes
τ (t) are quadratic functions of the Kähler parameters ti with coefficients κijk that jump
across phases. However, τ (t) are continuous and once differentiable, giving rise to a path
that is continuous, with no cusps. This enables us to follow the path efficiently.
Then, our final task is to devise a numerical algorithm that starts from tinit and follows
the continuous path towards t? . We first divide the path into N  1 small sections, by
considering the set of points defined by α = m/N , m = 0, . . . , N , denoting the corresponding points in E(X)◦ and K(X) by τm and tm , respectively. Following the path is then
38

Note that this algorithm can fail to converge in some examples, e.g. if there is an unknown autochthonous divisor that has negative volume at the candidate point. Conversely, if the algorithm succeeds,
all possible autochthonous divisors have positive volume.

corrections in (4.11) need to be incorporated systematically. Clearly, this can only be done
inside the radius of convergence of the type IIB worldsheet instanton expansion, where
at most finitely many curves contribute sizeable corrections. Assuming a solution exists39

Gopakumar-Vafa invariants

In order to carry out the algorithm that we have just described, we need to compute the
genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants N of X. For a general threefold X these can be
obtained via mirror symmetry, by computing the expansion of the period vector of the
e around LCS [79, 80, 82]. The results of [13, 81] can in principle be used

Verifying this assumption is the subject of §5.4.

of X and a simplicial cone containing the Mori cone M(X) are in hand.
However, with presently-available software it is not feasible to systematically compute
GV invariants in threefolds with h1,1  10, and in particular to do so at the high degrees
needed for our purposes. In [15] we will present improved methods that allowed us to
compute GV invariants in the regime of interest. Here we will restrict ourselves to reviewing
a few facts that are relevant for the present work.
First, along certain rational rays r in the Mori cone, the GV invariants come in infinite
families: for kq ∈ r, there are infinitely many k ∈ N for which Nkq 6= 0. We call such a
curve class q a potent curve, and we call r a potent ray. Along such rays, the GV invariants
typically grow exponentially: see §5.4. We denote by M∞ (X) the closure of the cone over
all potent rays.
Second, along special rays, often outside of M∞ (X), the GV invariants come in isolated
sets associated with a curve class q and a finite number of its multiples: we have Nkq 6= 0
for finitely many k ∈ N (and often, for only one such k). We call such a curve class q a
nilpotent curve, and we call r a nilpotent ray. Nilpotent curve classes that lie outside of
M∞ (X) are collapsible P1 ’s.
The dual of M∞ (X) contains the extended Kähler cone [91], and sufficiently far out
in this cone the instanton expansion converges, even if a number of collapsible curves are
arbitrarily small. If a candidate solution t ∈ KX of the F-flatness conditions lies at a point
in the (extended) Kähler cone where some number of collapsible curves are small, we can
simply evaluate the di-logarithms in (5.13) to account for these.
Although small collapsible curves are relatively innocuous, small curves in M∞ (X) are
not. We will need to check that all curves in M∞ (X) are large: at least, large enough so
that at most a few contribute appreciably to the right-hand side of (5.13). In other words,
we will need to ensure that there exists a solution to the F-flatness conditions within the
radius of convergence of the instanton expansion. We now turn to this final check.

5.4

Radius of convergence

The LCS singularity is never the only singularity in moduli space, so the worldsheet instanton expansion generally has a finite radius of convergence around any point. Along
any fixed direction t = λt0 in the Kähler cone KX , with λ > 0, there should exist λc > 0
such that the expansion converges for all λ > λc and diverges for all λ < λc .
The coefficients of the instanton terms in the prepotential are governed by the GV

and the arguments of the polylogarithm become arbitrarily small far out in the Mori cone.
To analyze the asymptotic behavior we first normalize t0 such that dq := q · t0 ∈ N, and
for k ∈ N we define
X
Nk :=
Nq .
(5.15)
q: dq =k

Then we consider

By the ratio test we have

,

(5.17)

and thus, GV invariants grow exponentially at large degree,
Nk ∼ e2πλc k ,

as k → ∞ .

(5.18)

This growth is a consequence of our assumption that the radius of convergence is finite.
Conversely, one can estimate the radius of convergence of the instanton expansion
by computing GV invariants. Although this approach does not give a formal proof of
control, being reliant on extrapolation to curves of arbitrarily large degree, it is still rather
powerful. The growth rate of GV invariants as a function of degree has been observed40
to asymptote very quickly to an exponential rate, which then gives a reliable estimate of
the radius of convergence. For example, in the case of the quintic, the leading estimate
(1)
1
1
is λc = 2π
log(N1 ) = 2π
log(2875) ≈ 1.27, whereas the actual radius of convergence is
λc ≈ 1.208 [79].
Though it is in general not feasible to compute GV invariants systematically to high
degree at large h1,1 , due to the sheer number of curve classes, it is possible to compute
to very high degree inside low-dimensional faces of the Mori cone. Moreover, by finding
an appropriate phase where a given face of M∞ (X) is also a face of M(X) one can
compute GV invariants in many low-dimensional faces of M∞ (X). In this way one can in
principle compute the GV invariants along a large number of rays in M∞ (X), forming a
full-dimensional cone, and we can test whether at a candidate point in moduli space the
worldsheet expansion truncated to that sector converges. This approach can never fully
40

See e.g. [79, 92–94].

36

prove control over the instanton expansion, as in principle there could exist a ray somewhere
in the interior of M∞ (X) with rapidly growing GV invariants. However, in examples one
usually observes that the growth rate of GV invariants in the interior of M∞ (X) is a simple
interpolation without extrema between the growth rates of the generators of M∞ (X).
Therefore, we do expect to be able to estimate control over the instanton expansion by
inspecting the curve classes of low-dimensional faces, as we will do in our examples.
Although the above approach will allow us to estimate the contributions of potent
curves, we will also need to incorporate nilpotent curves, to which we now turn. Finding
lattice points in the Mori cone at large h1,1 is a difficult task by itself, and when further
restricting the search to curves with non-vanishing GV invariants it becomes seemingly insurmountable. However, we have devised a method that begins by finding curves inherited
from the toric ambient variety, which by a slight abuse of terminology we refer to as toric
curves. Many such curves turn out to have non-vanishing GV invariants. In fact, the set
of toric curves generally contains the Hilbert basis of the Mori cone in the examples with
small h1,1 where a fully systematic comparison is possible. This is extremely helpful for
our purposes, because the Hilbert basis contains the smallest (and hence most important)
effective curves.
Our approach is then as follows. From the set of toric curves we pick those with
volumes41 less than, say, 2, which gives us a few hundred curves. We remove the curves
that can be written as sums of others, and so are not Hilbert basis elements, and can then
compute the GV invariants of the remainder. In examples at small h1,1 we have found that
the curves found in this way account for the great majority of curves with non-vanishing
GV invariants below the volume threshold in question.
In the examples described below, we are able to systematically compute GV invariants
of all effective curves with volumes . 0.1, and, among the O(100, 000) curves included,
the O(10) curves with non-vanishing GV invariants are none other than the toric curves!
Along with the fact that all of the small toric curves have O(1) GV invariants, we expect
to have captured the most important contributions to the instanton expansion. Thus, we
can find the leading few hundred terms instead of the O(10) that we would have been able
to obtain with a more direct approach.
41

For this purpose we scale the Kähler parameters homogeneously, corresponding to cτ = 1, so that the
details of the flux vacuum are immaterial.

Examples

Our procedure for constructing vacua can be applied to a very large number of geometries.
In principle the approach is valid for a fair fraction of all the threefolds resulting from the
Kreuzer-Skarke list. However, with present tools the search for flux vacua becomes costly
for h2,1 & 10, as the flux lattice dimension is then at least 20.42 At the same time, explicitly
checking convergence of the worldsheet instanton corrections to the Kähler potential by
computing genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants to high degrees becomes expensive for
h1,1 & 50, and requires special methods for h1,1  100.
In this work we have restricted our attention to polytopes that admit simple orientifolds
in which there are at least h1,1 pure rigid prime toric divisors. For h2,1 ≤ 4 the search over
flux quanta is inexpensive, and one can find hundreds of supersymmetric AdS4 vacua with
W0 . 10−10 in minutes on a laptop. Most of the polytopes that we have checked do in fact
admit such vacua.
In a few polytopes one can easily find extremely small values, W0 . 10−50 . In a larger
class of polytopes, such values emerge after a more determined search, while in other
polytopes we have not yet found such enormous hierarchies.
In this section we present a few illustrative vacua. Each example is defined by a
pair of reflexive polytopes (∆◦ , ∆) and triangulations defining toric varieties (V, Ve ) and
e chosen such that our flux vacua lie in the Kähler
their Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces (X, X),

Approaches such as those of [95, 96] might aid in finding flux vacua at larger h2,1 .

corresponding to the vertices in (6.1).
We consider a type IIB O3/O7 orientifold of X defined by the involution of V ,
Ib : x1 7→ −x1 .

(6.4)

A few key properties of this orientifold, independent of the choice of FRST, are:
2,1
• h1,1
− (X) = h+ (X) = 0, and thus no geometric moduli are projected out.

• There is an O7-plane on the divisor D1 with h• (D1 , OD1 ) = (1, 0, 2).
• There are 25 O7-planes wrapping other prime toric divisors, all of which are rigid.
• There are 48 O3-planes at the triple intersections of certain prime toric divisors.
39

χ
• The D3-brane tadpole is equal to 4f = 12 h1,1 (X) + h2,1 (X) + 1 = 60.
As stated in §2, we cancel the D7-brane tapole locally, so each of the rigid divisors hosting
an O7-plane actually hosts a confining N = 1 pure Yang-Mills theory with gauge algebra
so(8), and in the absence of fluxes the divisor D1 hosts an N = 1 Yang-Mills theory with
the same gauge algebra and two adjoint chiral multiplets.
Our first task will be to find flux vacua of the form described in §2. The prime toric

divisors {D̃1 , D̃2 , D̃3 , D̃4 , D̃5 } of X

The exponential smallness of W0 is manifestly a result of the hierarchy in the GV invariants

The GV invariants are of course intrinsic to the geometry, while the 7/28 : 7/29 racetrack
results from the choice of fluxes in (6.7), through the perturbatively flat direction (6.8)
that these fluxes leave open.
Our next task is to stabilize the Kähler moduli. For this purpose, we first note that

of which 83 are pure regardless of triangulation, while 8 have the property that h2,1 (D)
depends on the triangulation.44 These 8 require careful examination.
The divisors in question are D3 , D7 , D8 , D9 , D43 , D44 , D45 , and D46 , and correspond to
points (3, 7, 8, 9, 43, 44, 45, 46) in a 2-face Θ(2) ⊂ ∆◦ with g(Θ(2) ) = 1. The points (3, 7, 8, 9)
are vertices of ∆◦ , while (43, 44, 45, 46) are interior to 1-faces: see Figure 1.
Let us define n(i) to be the number of lines interior to Θ(2) that are connected to the
point i. Then we compute [50],
b 3 ) = 1 + n(3) , h2,1 (D
b 7 ) = n(7) , h2,1 (D

and for any point i ∈ (43, 44, 45, 46) we obtain
b i ) = n(i) − 1 .

(6.16)

The triangulation depicted in Figure 1 corresponds to a phase in which we have found
a solution to the F-flatness conditions for the Kähler moduli. In this phase, of the eight
divisors corresponding to points in Θ(2) , only D7 , D9 , D43 , D44 , D45 , and D46 support
leading contributions to the nonperturbative superpotential. In particular, in this phase
the volumes of D3 and D8 exceed the volumes of the leading contributors by a factor ∼ 30,
so any potential instantons from D3 or D8 would be completely negligible. Comparing
Figure 1 to (6.15) and (6.15), we see that D7 , D9 , D43 , D44 , D45 , and D46 are all pure in
this phase. Thus we have 25 + 83 + 6 = 114 superpotential terms with constant Pfaffians,
all of which make commensurate contributions to the potential for the Kähler moduli, and
omitting all divisors that are not pure and rigid is self-consistent.
In sum, taking the triangulation of Θ(2) shown in Figure 1, we have specified a compactification with KKLT superpotential, as defined in §4, and have found a supersymmetric
AdS4 vacuum therein.
At the corresponding point t? in Kähler moduli space, the volume of X in string units

is Vst ≈ 945.18, while the Einstein-frame volume of X is VE = Vst gs
≈ 8.1 × 105 . The
divisors supporting the leading Euclidean D3-branes have Einstein-frame volumes ≈ 22,
while the divisors hosting gaugino condensates are six times larger.
We now examine the volumes of curves at t? . There are 238 curves that are complete

This issue will not arise in the further examples presented below: the leading prime toric divisors
there will be pure and rigid in all triangulations.

intersections of toric divisors and have volumes ≤ 1, and we have incorporated these curves
in (5.13). Moreover, by computing GV invariants systematically we have determined that
these 238 curves include all the effective curves with volume ≤ 0.05 that contribute to the
Kähler potential and the definition of the holomorphic coordinates (4.11). Based on the
distribution of curve volumes, we expect not to have missed curves with volumes . 0.5.

we thus understand all relevant contributions to (4.11) from worldsheet instantons, provided that our solution point is in fact inside the radius of convergence of the instanton
expansion. While we cannot compute the GV invariants along all rays in M∞ (X) in a
completely systematic manner, we have found 1728 random rays inside low-dimensional
faces of M∞ (X), spanning a 101-dimensional cone, and computed their GV invariants to
very high degree. For each such ray, we clearly see that the associated series of worldsheet
instanton corrections converges and is negligible overall. This is shown in Figure 2, where
we plot the quantity
ξn := Nnq e−2πn q·t ,

The growth rate with degree is evidently exponential, and the computation out to
100 C 0 shows that the rate is very stable. We therefore have high confidence in assessing
the impact of the curves in our sample.
We also note that perturbative corrections in α0 , and worldsheet instanton corrections,

Discussion

The vacua that we have constructed are novel incarnations of the ideas of Kachru, Kallosh,
Linde, and Trivedi, with one important distinction: the mechanism of [5]46 for producing
an exponentially small flux superpotential leaves an imprint in the pattern of moduli expectation values.
Recall that we began by finding quantized three-form fluxes f~, ~h for which there exists
an exactly flat direction in the joint axiodilaton and complex structure moduli space of a
Calabi-Yau threefold X, at the level of the perturbative prepotential for these moduli. We
termed such a configuration a perturbatively flat vacuum. The true prepotential includes
nonperturbative corrections that can be understood as worldsheet instantons of type IIA
e For the type IIB theory these are, of course,
string theory on the mirror threefold X.
classical effects, and they affect the classical Gukov-Vafa-Witten flux superpotential via
(2.6). Taking fluxes f~, ~h that yield a perturbatively flat vacuum and evaluating the true
flux superpotential along the flat direction and near large complex structure, the result
is then exponentially small. Typically such a configuration is a runaway, but for suitably
restricted f~, ~h the worldsheet instanton terms form a racetrack that stabilizes the moduli
along the flat direction.
One feature of this mechanism is that the dilaton is stabilized near weak coupling and
the complex structure moduli are stabilized near large complex structure. In particular,
gs ∝ 1/log(W0−1 ). Because the F-flatness conditions for the Kähler moduli stabilize the
divisors at Einstein-frame volumes Re(Ti ) ∝ log(W0−1 ), we find a solution in which the
string-frame volumes of divisors and curves are not parametrically large or small, even
though their Einstein-frame volumes are large. As we carefully explained in §4, control of
the α0 expansion then depends on whether the smallest effective curves in X happen to be
large enough for the worldsheet instanton series to converge. Specifically, these worldsheet
instanton contributions to the Kähler potential are automatically accounted for by the
classical Kähler potential of the mirror O6 orientifold in type IIA, and can thus be computed
accurately by computing the periods of the mirror threefold.47 Because the radius of
convergence can be inferred from the asymptotic growth of genus-zero Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants, we were able to establish control in examples by computing these invariants.
Another feature is that one complex direction in the axiodilaton and complex structure

moduli space — the perturbatively flat direction — receives a mass of order W0 , which is
also the mass scale of the Kähler moduli.
Neither of these features is required by the KKLT mechanism per se, nor were they
foreseen for other reasons, but they are characteristic of our class of constructions.
The statistics of the cosmological constants in our vacua deserve some comment. We
have found solutions with vacuum energy of magnitude 10−200 in Planck units, without a
search of commensurate cost.48 The methods that we have developed to construct orientifolds, identify rigid divisors, find F-flat solutions, and compute Gopakumar-Vafa invariants, all at large h1,1 , are fairly novel, and we believe they could be of use in the future.
However, these are pieces of technology for studying compactifications in general, and not
specifically for finding vacua with small vacuum energy. Indeed, it is almost incidental
that h1,1  1 in our examples: except for considerations of the D3-brane charge tadpole,
increasing h1,1 has no evident benefit in our constructions.
But the core problem in searching for small vacuum energy in a landscape of flux vacua
is (expected to be) that of choosing the right fluxes. One might naively anticipate that to
find a flux superpotential of order 10−100 , one will have to search in a very high-dimensional
lattice, say of dimension ∼ O(100), and explore a vast number of choices. In our work
this is not the case. We have h2,1 = 4 in an example with W0 ≈ 10−90 , so the lattice is
eight-dimensional, and the search for flux vectors takes just minutes on a laptop.
An underlying reason is that by finding fluxes that allow for perturbatively flat vacua,
we have arranged that the sum over all perturbative — and hence, possibly large —
contributions to the superpotential actually vanishes, and what remains is suppressed by
exponentials in the mirror worldsheet instanton expansion around large complex structure.
Thus, our construction includes a fine-tuned and exact cancellation of a vast array of orderunity perturbative contributions to the superpotential. The possibility of such an exact
cancellation hinges on the quantization of parameters in string theory: the superpotential, in particular, is determined by essentially integer data. Because of this cancellation,
everything appearing in the final expression for the vacuum energy is proportional to a nonperturbative effect, either a Euclidean D3-brane or strong gauge dynamics on a four-cycle
e
in X, or a worldsheet instanton of type IIA wrapping a curve in X.
In this sense, our construction of exponentially small flux superpotentials, and exponentially small vacuum energy, is natural, in the sense of dimensional transmutation.49
48
For discussions of the complexity of related problems, see e.g. [98], as well as the analysis in [99] of
the simpler landscape of [100].
49
Of course, solving the cosmological constant problem would require exponentially small vacuum energy
after supersymmetry breaking, which we have certainly not achieved!

55

One might wonder if a similar mechanism is at work in our universe, perfectly cancelling
perturbative contributions to the vacuum energy and lifting it to the observed value in a
nonperturbative fashion.
There is of course some tuning of discrete data in our solutions: we had to choose
X with suitable patterns of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in order to support a racetrack of
worldsheet instantons, and find fluxes allowing compatible perturbatively flat vacua. But a
polynomial degree of tuning of such integers leads to exponential hierarchies in the vacuum
energy: for example, in a threefold with (h2,1 , h1,1 ) = (5, 113) we found

W0 ∝

29

≈ 10−61 .

(7.1)

In this example the numbers 2 and 252 arise as the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the
two leading curves, while the exponent 29 results from the 7/28 : 7/29 racetrack (6.11) of
worldsheet instantons on these curves, which is a consequence of the flux choice (6.7).50
Our results suggest a new perspective on the abundance of vacua with small W0 in the
type IIB flux landscape. The classic statistical treatment of [21] relied on approximating
the fluxes as continuous. In this approximation, applied to a model where N is the total

number of flux vacua, the smallest value of W0 that one expects to find is of order 1/ N
[21]. However, we have exhibited solutions in which W0 is hierarchically smaller than this
prediction. The resolution of this mismatch is that our solutions critically rely on the values
of flux integers: the conditions for a perturbatively flat vacuum, which are equations over
the integers, are fulfilled in a set of measure zero within the space of continuous fluxes.
Thus, our vacua are not captured in the statistics of [21]. A systematic treatment of the
statistics of small W0 is an interesting task for the future.
The alert reader will have recognized that the solutions presented here are completely
unrealistic: the cosmological constant is negative and N = 1 supersymmetry is preserved.
While it is possible that solutions in the class given here could be uplifted to de Sitter vacua,
in order to exhibit maximal parametric control and maximal scale-separation we have
focused on examples in which the magnitude of the superpotential is extremely small. Thus,
the gravitino is far too light, as are the Kähler moduli and the previously-perturbativelyflat complex structure direction. Even if the cosmological constant were small and positive
after uplifting, the degree of supersymmetry breaking would be unrealistically small, and
moreover the moduli problem would almost surely be fatal for cosmology.
50

In the other four examples we presented, the racetracks took the form 34/280 : 35/280, 8/30 : 9/30,
9/24 : 10/24, and 32/110 : 33/110.

56

Nevertheless, we view these solutions as stepping stones to realistic vacua. In this work
we have restricted our attention to configurations in which we could establish control of
corrections in the α0 expansion with our present knowledge of these corrections, and with
our present ability to compute Gopakumar-Vafa invariants at large h1,1 . With improved
capabilities one could doubtless explore a much wider parameter space, including examples
in which W0  1 but, say, W0 & 10−10 . We have found hundreds of examples of this form,
but sifting out those among them that are best-controlled is a task for the future. Uplifts
of such vacua could in principle allow for realistic cosmology and particle physics.
At the same time, our solutions are instructive in their own right, because they present
a slightly different perspective on the cosmological constant problem in string theory than
one finds following [21, 101, 102].

Conclusions

We have demonstrated that supersymmetric AdS4 vacua with exponentially small vacuum
energy can be constructed in large numbers in orientifolds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in
toric varieties.
The geometry, orientifolding, quantized fluxes, and D-brane configurations in our constructions are all totally explicit. We enumerated nonperturbative superpotential terms
that suffice to stabilize all the Kähler moduli, and we ensured that all Pfaffian prefactors
AD of Euclidean D3-brane superpotential terms are constants, with no dependence on the
moduli. Lacking a theory of the Pfaffians, we were not able to compute these numbers,
but we nevertheless established that well-controlled vacua exist for a wide range of values
of the AD .
Our analysis relied on novel techniques that we have developed for constructing orientifold configurations and computing Gopakumar-Vafa invariants at large h1,1 , as well as for
finding F-theory uplifts and computing the Hodge numbers of divisors therein. We hope
to present more details of these methods in the near future [15, 31, 32, 50].
There are several directions for future work. Computing the Pfaffian numbers AD would
be valuable. It would be interesting to extend our construction beyond hypersurfaces in
toric varieties, and to develop dual descriptions of similar vacua, in compactifications of
F-theory, M-theory, or type IIA string theory. Exploring constraints on the conformal
field theories dual to our solutions would also be worthwhile. Perhaps the most pressing
question is whether some of our solutions can be uplifted to de Sitter vacua of string theory.

Comments on de Sitter vacua

The supersymmetric AdS4 solutions that we have constructed clearly serve as stepping
stones towards de Sitter vacua in type IIB compactifications. However, in the body of the
paper we have not confronted the question of an uplift to de Sitter space: our intention
was to first achieve optimal control in supersymmetric solutions.
In this Appendix we briefly describe an observation that may be relevant for the question of control over the backreaction from seven-branes, as discussed in the recent literature [103–105]. The potential problem observed in [103] is that an anti-D3-brane uplift
requires a tuning of a throat hierarchy [16, 28]

also sets the transverse size of the throat, it would follow that one
However, as ND3
cannot consistently glue in the warped throat into a weakly-warped larger bulk threefold X.
Attempting to shrink VE to the required small size then causes warp factor singularities,
which are otherwise localized exponentially close to the seven-branes, to move into the
bulk [103,104]. These singularities were discussed further in [105], where it was shown that
nonperturbative effects in the α0 expansion can resolve the singularities, leaving behind
a strongly-curved but non-singular region in X. Although it then follows that the bulk
physics is regular, computing the Kähler potential in such a regime is a formidable task.
The results of [105] lead to a slight puzzle: at least in the simple example where the
seven-brane singularity emerges from a D7-brane stack wrapped on K3, one finds that the
transverse distance between the classically singular locus and the position of the sevenbranes is of order
!

(A.5)
|ND3,K3 |
where ND3,K3 is the D3-brane charge hosted on the seven-brane stack and RCY is the
radius of X. This result immediately generalizes to other seven-brane configurations.
Thus, for a more general collection of seven-branes one would expect that singularities are
exponentially controlled if all Einstein frame divisor volumes are larger than the D3-brane
charges hosted on those divisors. In fact, this is precisely the constraint we have imposed
in (4.17). However, more singular outcomes are possible in some cases, as a large number
of sources of small amounts of D3-brane charge can source a macroscopic singularity via
their collective charge seen at long distances, as discussed for the case of a gas of O3-planes
in [104], but such singularities are generally evaded if the overall volume satisfies
2

(A.6)

which is precisely our constraint (4.18). Now we have come full circle and recovered again
the tension between supergravity control (A.6) and the KKLT regime (A.4).
Up to this point we have been reviewing the recent literature, but let us add a new

59

observation. In the models that we have constructed, the volume VE is much larger than
predicted by (A.3). For example, in the vacuum detailed in §6.1 we found Re(T )i ≈ 22, so
the naive guess (A.3) would predict VE ≈ 103, whereas we find VE ≈ 8.1 × 105 . In this
case the relation (A.3) underestimates VE by a factor of ∼ 8000.
This finding has nothing to do with the smallness of W0 , but is simply a generic,
purely geometric property of Calabi-Yau threefolds at large h1,1 : when a full-dimensional
collection of effective divisors have volumes of order unity, the overall volume can become
quite large [106].
To be concrete, in our example of §6.4 one can imagine that the entire D3-brane charge
ND3 = 110 allowed by the D3-brane tadpole contributes to the formation of a warped
216
, and that the F3 flux on the
throat, that a perturbatively flat vacuum arises with cτ = 110

where the large prefactor 4711 is a concrete manifestation of the fact that setting volumes
of low-dimensional cycles to moderate values can result in very large volumes of higherdimensional cycles when h1,1 is large [106].
52

Note that a more stringent constraint gs M 2 & 50 has been claimed [107], though it is not entirely
clear to us that the effective field theory employed there is reliable in the relevant regime. Even so, using
their constraint one still finds W0min ≈ 10−4 , which is quite small nevertheless. We note further that the
radius of curvature in string units is R2 ∼ gs M , which is less than unity for M = 12 and gs = 1/144, but
in this case the physics is controlled by the Klebanov-Strassler gauge theory instead [16], and we see no
reason why metastable supersymmetry breaking should disappear in this regime.

Thus, instead of (A.4) one then finds

 ND3 = 110 ,
2π

(A.10)

even for rather modest values of W0 , and the warping control criteria of (4.17) and (4.18)
are comfortably satisfied. We stress again that this has nothing to do with the smallness of
the flux superpotential — even for the smallest allowed superpotential of (A.8), the ratio
log(1/W0 )
only reaches the modest value 0.67 — but instead results from the scaling of cycle
2πND3
volumes with h1,1 . While many curves in turn have small string frame volumes at this
point in moduli space, we have argued that, in this instance, the Kähler potential receives
no dangerous corrections from such curves: indeed, we showed explicitly that a large set
of infinite towers of worldsheet instantons yield negligible corrections.
In this work we have not actually constructed a warped throat in such an example,53
but the above parameter values do not appear out of reach. We conclude that there is
no evident obstacle to circumventing the problems pointed out in [104, 105], by finding an
appropriate Calabi-Yau compactification that unifies the above scaling of (A.10) with an
appropriately warped throat, even without realizing the contrived O3-plane configurations
suggested in [104]. The tools to engineer such models have been developed in [6, 7], but
using them to build a controlled KKLT de Sitter vacuum is a task for the future.

With the above parameters such a throat would have flux quanta (M, K) ∼ (12, 9), which does not
seem unreasonable at all.
