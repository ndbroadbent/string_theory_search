Abstract
We establish an orientifold Calabi-Yau threefold database for h1,1 (X) ≤ 6 by
considering non-trivial Z2 divisor exchange involutions, using a toric Calabi-Yau
database (www.rossealtman.com/tcy). We first determine the topology for each
individual divisor (Hodge diamond), then identify and classify the proper involutions
which are globally consistent across all disjoint phases of the Kähler cone for each
unique geometry. Each of the proper involutions will result in an orientifold CalabiYau manifold. Then we clarify all possible fixed loci under the proper involution,
thereby determining the locations of different types of O-planes. It is shown that
under the proper involutions, one typically ends up with a system of O3/O7-planes,
and most of these will further admit naive Type IIB string vacua. The geometries
with freely acting involutions are also determined. We further determine the splitting
of the Hodge numbers into odd/even parity in the orbifold limit. The final result
is a class of orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds with non-trivial odd class cohomology
∗
(h1,1
− (X/σ ) 6= 0).

Introduction

String compactification is crucial for high dimensional string theory to describe the four
dimensional real world. The methods for doing so are best understood for supersymmetric
compactifications, where without turning on more general fluxes, the compactification
manifold must be a Calabi-Yau threefold, X. Compactifying a Type IIA or Type IIB
string theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold results in an N = 2 supersymmetric theory in four
dimensions. In order to break the theory further to an N = 1 supersymmetric theory in
four dimensions, one must perform an orientifold projection on one of the two gravitinos of
the theory. As a result, among the vast number of Calabi-Yau threefolds, those that permit
such an orientifold under some proper Z2 involution, σ, are of great phenomenological
interest. In this paper, we extend and improve on previous work [1] classifying nontrivial Z2 divisor exchange involutions in Calabi-Yau threefolds for h1,1 (X) ≤ 6, using a
database [2] (www.rossealtman.com/tcy) constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke dataset of
reflexive four-dimensional polyhedra [3]. For a general review on flux compactification on
these orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds and the landscape of string vacua, see [4–11].
In this work, we focus on Type IIB orientifold geometries where an orientifold projection
O is generally composed of two parts. One is the worldsheet parity Ωp , and another one is
a diffeomorphism map σ acting on the internal manifold, i.e, the involution. The involution
σ is a non-trivial Z2 action on the Calabi-Yau space such that σ 2 = 1. In order for the
orientifold action to still preserve some supersymmetry, the involution must be isometric
and holomorphic [12, 13]. These conditions require that the pullback σ ∗ of the involution
must always map (p, q)-forms to (p, q)-forms on X. In particular, the Kähler (1, 1)-form J
must be preserved and the unique holomorphic (3, 0)-form Ω must be an eigenform of σ ∗
with eigenvalues ±1.
The geometry may contain some fixed loci under the involution σ, which will correspond
to orientifold planes (O-planes). The precise structure of the orientifold projection O in
Type IIB is determined according to the different O-plane systems relevant in D-brane
constructions:
(
Ωp σ
with σ ∗ (J) = J , σ ∗ (Ω3 ) = +Ω3 , O5/O9 system,
O=
(1)
(−1)FL Ωp σ with σ ∗ (J) = J , σ ∗ (Ω3 ) = −Ω3 , O3/O7 system,
where FL is the left-moving fermion number.
If there is no fixed locus and the orientifold is smooth, such an involution describes
a freely-acting Z2 . This, however, is non-trivial since under the orientifold action, the
Calabi-Yau threefold may acquire new singularities. In general, the involution σ splits the
cohomology groups H p,q (X/σ ∗ ) into eigenspaces of even and odd parity:
H p,q (X/σ ∗ ) = H+p,q (X/σ ∗ ) ⊕ H−p,q (X/σ ∗ ).

(2)

In particular, Calabi-Yau orientifolds with non-trivial odd equivariant cohomology class
H−1,1 (X/σ ∗ ) play an important role in string phenomenology. In Type IIB orientifold com∗
pactifications with O3/O7-planes, when h1,1
− (X/σ ) > 0, there are non-trivial involutively
1,1
odd moduli (ba , ca ), a = 1, · · · , h− (X/σ ∗ ), in the bosonic closed spectrum coming from
the R-R and NS-NS two-form fields C2 and B2 respectively. These odd moduli can be
3

stabilized by D-term conditions [14] or by F-term conditions [15, 16]. In the Type IIB
orientifold compactifications of both the KKLT [17] and Large Volume Scenario [18], these
axion-like odd moduli can drive inflation [19–36] in the natural, monodromy, and aligned
inflationary models, and play an important role in the recently discussed Weak Gravity
Conjecture and Swampland Conjecture (first proposed in [37, 38] and see [39–41] for a
detailed review). In addition to these moduli stabilization and inflationary models, many
efforts have been made to combine the global issues with local issues, such as constructing
global string compactifications that can simultaneously describe D-brane models of particle physics. One of the most serious obstacles to this is the tension between chirality and
moduli-fixing by non-perturbative effects [42]. Several potential solutions, however, have
already been proposed by carefully analyzing the Freed-Witten anomaly and Kähler cone
condition [43], tuning on fluxed-instantons on the divisors [44, 45] or putting the D-brane
at the singularity [46–53]. In most of these approaches, finding Calabi-Yau threefolds with
∗
a non-trivial odd cohomology h1,1
− (X/σ ) is a crucial ingredient.
A great deal of progress has been made in understanding the statistical structure of
the moduli in many classes of Calabi-Yau threefolds, by brute force calculation and scans,
without considering the orientifold involution explicitly, and how this relates to properties
such as the axion landscape or Swiss cheese structure [54–61]. Recently, in the context
of Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds (CICYs) embedded in products of projective
spaces [62], a landscape of orientifold vacua has been constructed [63, 64] from the most
favorable description of the CICY 3-folds database [65]. More general free quotients have
been classified and studied in the case of CICY 3- and 4-folds [66–69]. Free quotients in
the toric case for h1,1 (X) ≤ 3 were systematically studied in [70] (See [71] for a recent
review on these Calabi-Yau database).
It would be a great step forward to provide, as an extension of our database of CalabiYau threefolds, a concrete classification of Calabi-Yau orientifold data, explicitly counting
the even and odd moduli, determining the types and numbers of fixed O-plane loci. This
is a primary motivating factor for this paper. In a previous work [1], divisor involutions in
Calabi-Yau threefolds up to h1,1 (X) = 4 with maximal triangulations were classified. In
this paper we will extend and improve this work in several respects:
1. We push our classification upper bound to h1,1 (X) = 6 in the Calabi-Yau database [2]
constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke list [3].
2. Instead of limiting ourselves to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in unique, fully desingularized toric varieties, we expand our analysis to hypersurfaces in all possible maximal
projective crepant partial (MPCP) desingularizations. The number of toric triangulations we will analyze increases by two orders of magnitude from 2,968 [1] to 646,903
independent phases.
3. We determine all individual topologies of divisors in each of the toric Calabi-Yau
threefolds. Furthermore, we improve our algorithm to determine the proper involution and identify the involutions which are globally consistent across all disjoint
phases of the Kähler cone for each unique Calabi-Yau geometry.
4. We identify all possible fixed loci under non-trivial actions, thereby determining the
location of different types of O-planes relevant in D-brane constructions. We then
4

further classify the involutions as freely or non-trivially acting depending on whether
there exists a fixed locus on the Calabi-Yau threefold under the involution.
5. In the orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds with an O3/O7-system, we then further
classify the so-called “naive orientifold Type IIB string vacua” by considering the D3
tadpole cancelation condition when putting eight D7-branes on top of the O7-plane.
6. We determine the equivariant cohomology (Hodge number splitting) under these
involutions in the Z2 -orbifold limit.
Since we only consider favorable Calabi-Yau threefolds, we will not include coordinate
reflections such as σ : xi ↔ −xi in this paper, as the corresponding divisor involution
1,1
σ ∗ : Di ↔ Di is manifestly trivial and will not contribute to h−
(X/σ ∗ ). When the
geometry is unfavorable, it contains a divisor with disconnected pieces like Pn ∪ · · · ∪ Pn ,
dPn ∪ · · · ∪ dPn or others. Under the reflection, these pieces exchange to one another
0,0
and split to h0,0
+ (D) and h− (D), which will contribute to the odd equivariant cohomology
1,1
h− (X/σ ∗ ) [1, 72].
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2.1, we briefly review the construction
of Calabi-Yau threefolds as hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Then, in Section 2.2 we show
how to compute the Hodge numbers of all toric divisors on a given Calabi-Yau threefold,
and classify these divisors according to topology, in a manner similar to [1]. We next
identify all pairs of “Non-trivial Identical Divisors” (NID) and present the proper divisor
involutions in Section 2.3. All fixed-point loci are then identified in Section 2.4, and this
information is used to classify the involutions as either non-trivially or freely acting. As
this is the heart of the current work, we take the time to describe our procedures in detail.
We additionally provide a pseudocode description of the fixed point algorithm in Appendix
A for those interested in the algorithm’s implementation. The cohomology class splitting
under these involutions is then determined in Section 2.5. We illustrate the procedures via
detailed examples in Section 3 and summarize our results in Section 4.

Constructing Calabi-Yau Orientifolds

2.1

Polytopes, Geometries, and Triangulations

It is a well-known result of Batyrev [73] that Calabi-Yau threefolds can generically be
obtained by taking the anticanonical hypersurface in an ambient four-dimensional Gorenstein toric Fano variety. In a previous work [2], the procedure for computationally extracting the topology of such a toric variety, as well as its restriction to the anticanonical
hypersurface, from combinatorical information encoded in a 4-dimensional reflexive lattice
polytope ∆, was outlined. In fact, a complete enumeration of all 4-dimensional reflexive
polytopes exists due to Kreuzer and Skarke [3].
In the context of toric geometry, when the toric divisor classes on the Calabi-Yau
hypersurface X are all descended from the ambient space A, we say that it is a favorable
geometry. Consider the short exact sequence and its dual sequence
0 → T X → T A|X → NX/A → 0,
∗
0 → NX/A
→ T ∗ A|X → T ∗ X → 0.

By Dolbeault’s theorem, H 1 (X, T ∗ X) ∼
= H 1,1 (X) ∼
= coker(α) ⊕ ker(β). It has two
contributions, the cokernel of the map α describes the descent of the Kähler moduli on A
to Kähler moduli on X, while the kernel of the map β describes some new Kähler moduli
on X which do not descend from A. If the kernel part is zero ker(β) = 0, the only divisors
on X are those descending from A (possibly with additional linear relations) and we say
the geometry is “favorable”1 . In this case h1,1 (X) = dim(H 1,1 (X)) ∼
= dim(Pic(A)). The
2
∗
simplest case of a favorable geometry is when h (X, N |X ) = 0 (or equivalently, when
h1 (X, N |X ) = 0). In this paper, we restrict us to study these so-called favorable geometry
and leave those unfavorable cases for future work.
If we restrict ourselves to smooth manifolds, we must at least partially desingularize the
ambient toric variety A by blowing up enough of its singular points that X is generically
smooth, but without adding any discrepancies to its cohomology class. A method for
doing such a maximal projective crepant partial (MPCP) desingularization involves the
triangulation of the polar dual reflexive polytope ∆∗ , which contains at least one fine, star,
regular triangulation (FSRT).
When the Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces of two or more desingularizations share certain
key topological invariants, then it can be shown that they are topologically equivalent
and can be considered representations of the same Calabi-Yau threefold. In this case, the
Kähler form of this Calabi-Yau threefold is allowed to reside within the Kähler cone of
either representation, and we refer to these disjoint Kähler cone chambers as its phases.
In order to allow the Kähler form to smoothly vary over its full range, the phases of the
Kähler cone must be glued together in an appropriate manner. In practice, we use Wall’s
theorem [76] to glue together the various phases of the complete Kähler cone corresponding
to a distinct Calabi-Yau threefold geometry, which requires the checking of whether or
not all singularities in the walls between these phases are avoided by the Calabi-Yau
hypersurface.
There are generally many MPCP desingularization configurations possible, each of
which sets different topological restrictions on how X can be deformed within A. These
deformations are parameterized by Kähler moduli, and the different configurations serve
to divide up the space of moduli into discontinuous chambers. When passing from one
chamber to another, some singular points are blown up, while others are blown down, so
that the singularities cannot be consistently resolved at the boundary. This exchange is
called a flop. Each distinct chamber defines a unique resolved ambient space Ã, and there
are, in general, many more of these than the original ambient toric varieties A.
1

There exits a stronger notion of “Kähler favourability” where Kähler cones on X descend from an
ambient space in which they are embedded [65]. This involve a careful set of arguments on the descent of
the effective, nef and ample cones of divisors which we refer the reader to see [74, 75]. In some cases, the
“favorable” geometry are not “Kähler favorable” since the Kähler cone of X is actually larger than the
positive orthant one we calculated following [2].

6

It often happens, however, that the smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface X does not intersect any of the singular points involved in a flop between chambers of the moduli space.
If, in addition, the topology of X is invariant under the flop, then the singularity can be
neglected for our purposes, and the chambers can be effectively glued and associated with
a single unique, smooth hypersurface X.
It is clear from the above discussion that obtaining an accurate count of unique, smooth
Calabi-Yau geometries a priori is highly non-trivial. However, the calculations have been
performed for geometries with Hodge number h1,1 (X) ≤ 6 [2].

2.2

Topology of Toric Divisors

We will assume the ambient space A to be a resolved Gorenstein toric Fano variety
with dimension n = 4 whose anticanonical divisor X = −KA is a Calabi-Yau threefold
hypersurface. Denote xi as the weighted homogeneous coordinates used to define X inside
the ambient space A. Then the divisor Di = {xi = 0} defines a 4-cycle on X which is dual
to a 2-cycle ωi .
In the context of toric geometry, a pair of “Non-trivial Identical Divisors” (NIDs) refers
to a pair of divisors with distinct charges under the torus action, but whose intersections
with the Calabi-Yau hypersurface have identical cohomology. In order to determine the
Hodge number of an individual divisor on the Calabi-Yau threefold, we use the Koszul
extension to the cohomCalg package [77, 78] with the HodgeDiamond module to calculate
these quantities. However, in many situations relevant to our purposes, this module cannot
give an explicit result.
For an irreducible divisor D, the complex conjugation hp,q (D) = hq,p (D) and Hodge
star hp,q (D) = h2−p,2−q (D) dualities constrain the independent Hodge numbers of D down
to only h1,0 (D), h2,0 (D), and h1,1 (D). As a result, when Rwe encounter difficulties with
cohomCalg, we first calculate the Euler number χ(D) = D c2 (D) of the divisor on the
hypersurface, and then determine h1,0 (D) and h2,0 (D) by calculating the trivial line bundle
cohomology of the divisor h• (D, OD ) = {h0,0 (D), h1,0 (D), h2,0 (D)} by chasing the Koszul
sequence:
0 → OA (−X − D) −→ OA (−X) ⊕ OA (−D) −→ OA −→ OD/X → 0 .

Then, using the expression

we can fix h1,1 (D) and get the full Hodge diamond for any divisor. The internal topology
of these divisors plays an important role in string compactification and moduli stabilization. In our procedure for scanning divisor involutions, several divisors classifications are
of particular phenomenological interest.2
Completely rigid divisor: The Hodge numbers of these divisors are characterized by
h• (D) = {h0,0 (D), h0,1 (D), h0,2 (D), h1,1 (D)} = {1, 0, 0, h1,1 (D)} such that h1,1 (D) 6= 0.
2

For the phenomenological relevance of these divisor types, see the discussion and references in [1].

7

This class of divisors is further subdivided into either the del Pezzo surfaces {P2 ≡ dP0 ,
dPn , with n = 1, . . . , 8} (which may be shrinkable or non-shrinkable depending on the
diagonalizability of its intersection tensor) with n = h1,1 (D) − 1, and the “non-shrinkable
rigid divisors” with h1,1 (D) > 9.
“Wilson” divisor: The Hodge numbers of these divisors are characterized by h• (D) =
{h0,0 (D), h0,1 (D), h0,2 (D), h1,1 (D)} = {1, h1,0 , 0, h1,1 } with h1,0 (D), h1,1 (D) 6= 0. We will
also further specify the “Exact-Wilson” divisor as h• (D) = {1, 1, 0, h1,1 } with h1,1 (D) 6= 0.
Deformation divisor: These divisors are characterized simply by h2,0 (D) 6= 0.
• A K3 divisor is a deformation divisor with Hodge numbers h• (D) = {1, 0, 1, 20}.
• Another deformation divisor that appears often in our scan is similar to a K3 divisor,
but with an extra h1,1 deformation degree of freedom, i.e. h• (D) = {1, 0, 1, 21}. We
will refer to this as a type-1 special deformation divisor, SD1.
• Another deformation divisor that appears in our classification has Hodge numbers
h• (D) = {1, 0, 2, 30}, which we refer to as SD2.
SD1 and SD2 appear to share similar properties, particularly in their volume forms.
In our scan, we will first identify the Hodge numbers of all the toric divisors on the CalabiYau hypersurface X, which descend from the ambient space A. This calculation will be
performed for each Calabi-Yau geometry in the database at www.rossealtman.com/tcy,
where the Hodge diamond of each divisors in the defining Calabi-Yau manifold is presented.

2.3

Holomorphic Divisor Exchange Involutions

The map σ : xi ↔ xj exchanging two homogeneous coordinates of the ambient toric
variety A can be pulled back to a holomorphic involution on the corresponding toric
divisor cohomology classes σ ∗ : Di ↔ Dj , which, on favorable manifolds, restricts in a
straightforward way to the Calabi-Yau hypersurface X. We then define the even and odd
parity eigendivisor classes D± ≡ Di ± Dj ∈ H±1,1 (X/σ ∗ ). In general, a given geometry can
allow multiple disjoint involutions σ1 , σ2 , . . . , σn . In this case, the full involution is given
by σ ≡ σ1 ◦ σ2 ◦ · · · ◦ σn .
We consider two divisors Di , Dj to be identical if h• (Di ) ∼
= h• (Dj ). They may nevertheless still be topologically distinct on X. This can readily be determined in favorable
geometries by inspecting their toric C∗ weights. If an identical pair of divisors also share the
same weights, then an involution σ exchanging them will act trivially on the hypersurface
∗
polynomial and will leave h1,1
− (X/σ ) = 0.
As mentioned earlier, from a phenomenological point of view, there are a variety of rea1,1
sons to work on a Calabi-Yau manifold with non-trivial odd parity h−
(X/σ ∗ ) > 0. Consequently, we consider only holomorphic divisor involutions between “Non-trivial Identical
Divisor pairs” (NIDs) in this work. After identifying the NIDs, we will check which involutions between these divisors are consistent with the topology of the Calabi-Yau manifold.
Since the hypersurface is embedded in a desingularized ambient variety A, we will require
our orientifold involution to be an automorphism of A, leaving invariant the exceptional
8

divisors from resolved singularities. The information describing the desingularization is
encoded in the Stanley-Reisner ideal ISR (A). As a consequence, the involution should be
a symmetry of ISR (A). We then further distinguish the “proper” involutions which are
symmetries of the linear ideal Ilin (A), encoding toric divisor redundancy. This ensures that
the defining polynomial of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface generically remains homogeneous
under the coordinate exchange without tuning any coefficients to zero. These involutions
are then also symmetries of the graded Chow ring
Z(D1 , · · · , Dk )
.
A• (A) ∼
=
Ilin (A) + ISR (A)

(7)

Due to the favorability condition on the Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface we have
A1 (A) ∼
= H 1,1 (A) ∼
= Pic(A) ∼
= Pic(X) ∼

and thus the toric triple intersection tensor defined in the Chow ring A4 (X) of Calabi-Yau
threefolds by

X = −KA =

will also remain invariant. If the involution involves non-rigid, deformation divisors, this
condition will ensure that they can be exchanged in a consistent way.
Let us consider a simple example with h1,1 (X) = 3. The triple intersection tensor can
be written in the basis of divisor class {J1 , J2 , J3 } ∈ H 1,1 (X; Z) as
Z
(10)
κijk = Ji ∧ Jj ∧ Jk ≡ Ji · Jj · Jk · X .
X

Suppose we have a proper involution σ ∗ : J2 ↔ J3 . Then, under the basis change
{J1 , J2 , J3 } 7→ {J0 , J+ , J− }

where

J± = J2 ± J3 ,

(11)

the intersection numbers with an odd number of minus indices (κ00− , κ++− , κ0+− , κ−−− )
should vanish identically. In this basis, we can write down the Kähler form J = t0 J0 +
t+ J+ + t− J− . For a consistent orientifold, we must have both σ ∗ J = J and σ ∗ Ω3 = −Ω3 ,
where Ω3 is the unique holomorphic (3,0)-form on X. The constraint onRthe Kähler form
given by eq.(1) can be used to to show that the Kähler cone condition ( C i J > 0) will be
consistently satisfied on the orientifold. The holomorphic (3,0)-form Ω3 can be constructed
in terms of the projective coordinates using the techniques in Section 5.6 of [8],

Here P is the hypersurface polynomial and ω = R(x)dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxk , with R(x) a homogeneous rational function of the xi that makes ω/P have zero weight. Since the hypersurface

9

we can take R(x) ≡ 1. Finally, the V a are the holomorphic vector fields generating the

Since we will be restricting the hypersurface polynomial P to be invariant under σ, the
numerator of the integrand, which we will here call Q, determines the parity. Its behavior
under σ can be calculated in a straightforward manner.
The procedure, then, is to first determine the Hodge numbers for all individual divisors
in a given triangulation, scan the database of Calabi-Yau threefolds extracted from the
Kreuzer-Skarke list up to h1,1 (X) = 6 and pick out the desingularized configurations (i.e.
triangulations of reflexive 4D polytopes) that support an exchange of NIDs. We then
identify all the “proper” involutions that allow for consistent orientifold geometries. Our
results are available via the database search engine at www.rossealtman.com/tcy, and
the statistics of this scan are summarized in Section 4. In the tables found in that section,
we further classify the different involutions into exchanges that include completely rigid
surfaces, Wilson surfaces, and some deformation surfaces.
Before continuing, let us take the opportunity to distinguish between two types of
involution:
V a = Σi Qai xi

• Triangulation-wise proper involution: The involutions present at the triangulation
level - that is, within a single chamber of the Kähler cone of a given geometry.
• Geometry-wise proper involution: The involutions which are globally consistent across
all disjoint phases of the Kähler cone for each unique Calabi-Yau geometry. Each of
the geometry-wise proper involutions may correspond to several triangulation-wise
involutions which can span an entire CY geometry.

Classifications of the Fixed Orientifold Planes

The next question to ask is whether there exist any point-wise fixed loci for a given
involution on the Calabi-Yau threefold. If there is a fixed codimension-n subvariety defined
by the simultaneous vanishing of n polynomials, then X will define an orientifold with an
Om plane, where m = 3 + 2(3 − n). For a Calabi-Yau threefold, we must have 0 ≤ n ≤ 3,
and so we can only have O9, O7, O5, or O3 planes. If we have none of these, and the
hypersurface determined by the σ-invariant Calabi-Yau polynomial is smooth, then the
involution is a free Z2 action on X.
We now present an algorithm for identifying and classifying fixed-point sets under
an orientifold of the type described in the previous section. We first define the MPCPdesingularized ambient 4D toric variety
A=

Ck r Z
(C∗ )k−4 × G

,

(14)

where Z is the locus of points in Ck ruled out by the Stanley-Reisner ideal ISR (A), and G
is the fundamental group (i.e. trivial in most cases3 ). The geometry on this toric variety
3

In the total favorable Kreuzer-Skarke list with h1,1 (X) ≤ 6, there are only 14 of them which have
non-trivial fundamental group. In this paper, we only consider the cases with trivial fundamental group.

can be described by the projective coordinates {x1 , ..., xk } and their toric C∗ equivalence
classes
(x1 , ..., xk ) ∼ (λWi1 x1 , ..., λWik xk ) ,

(15)

which define a projective weight matrix W.
Throughout this section, we use the following notation:
• k is the number of toric divisors
• p is the number of (disjoint) coordinate exchanges (in Section 2.4.1)
• k 0 = |G| is the number of definite parity polynomial generators (in Section 2.4.3)
• W̃ is the weight matrix of the definite parity generators (in Section 2.4.3)
• r is the rank of W̃ (in Section 2.4.3)
2.4.1

Invariant Calabi-Yau hypersurface polynomial

Consider the smooth Calabi-Yau anticanonical hypersurface X = −KA defined by the
vanishing of a homogeneous polynomial {P = 0}. The polynomial P can be expressed in
terms of the known vertices m ∈ M, n ∈ N of the Newton and dual polytopes, respectively
P =

X

am Mm = 0,

where

Mm =

k
Y

hm,ni i+1

xi

.

(16)

i=1

m∈∆

An involution of the type that we are considering will consist of a set of p fully disjoint
coordinate exchanges, σs : xis ↔ xjs , s = 1, . . . , p and σ = σ1 ◦ · · · ◦ σp . In order for the
Calabi-Yau hypersurface to be invariant under σ, we must restrict to the subset of moduli
space in which the defining polynomial is invariant. To check this, we define the set of
monomials M = {Mm |m ∈ ∆}. Then for Mm , Mm0 ∈ M, we identify three cases:
1. σ(Mm ) = Mm

⇒

am is generic,

2. σ(Mm ) = Mm0 , m 6= m0
3. σ(Mm ) 6∈ M

⇒

⇒

am = am0 ,

am = 0.

Clearly, imposing these restrictions requires some tuning in the complex structure moduli space, but the end result is that P 7→ Psymm such that σ(Psymm ) = Psymm , in addition
to σ ∗ J = J. It is important to note that this tuning may introduce singularities into the
CY hypersurface. The MPCP desingularization of the ambient space A only guarantees
resolution of singularities with codimension larger than two, and by Bertini’s theorem we
can expect that the Calabi-Yau polynomial avoids them. However, now that we have required some coefficients to vanish, it is not necessarily the case that the hypersurface will
avoid these singularities.
We can now search for the set of points fixed under σ. We first locate the fixed-point
set in the ambient space, and only later restrict this set to the Calabi-Yau hypersurface.4
4

This restriction can be done in a straightforward manner since we only consider favorable manifolds.

2.4.2

Minimal generating set of homogeneous polynomials with definite-parity

Any subvariety V can be described as an intersection of hypersurfaces, each generated
by a single homogenous polynomial. When V is point-wise fixed under an involution σ,
it must be contained within the eigenspace of σ. This, however, does not imply that each
individual hypersurface is in the eigenspace of σ. Consider, for example, the following case:

σ◦f =g
V = {x ∈ A | f (x) = g(x) = 0}, with
.
(17)
σ◦g =f
Clearly, in this scenario the subvariety (i.e. intersection of hypersurfaces) remains fixed
under the involution while each individual hypersurface does not5 , and therefore does not
have a definitely parity under σ. In order to reduce the search space, and therefore the
computational complexity of our scan, we restrict to only fixed point loci and corresponding
orientifold planes whose hyperplane generators have definite parity under the involution
σ. We leave the identification of the remaining orientifold planes to future work.
With this in mind, we look for the minimal generating set G of homogeneous polynomials y(x1 , ..., xk ) that are (anti-)invariant under σ. Each of these generators then has
definite parity σ(y) = ±y for each y ∈ G.
Clearly, the monomials in M satisfying case (1) above are included in G. In addition, we
define the subset G0 ⊂ {x1 , ..., xk } of the projective coordinates that are left unexchanged
by σ. Then, for ease of notation, we can define the orthogonal decomposition
G = G0 ∪ G+ ∪ G− .

(18)

In order to determine these generating polynomials, we note that because σ 2 = 1, any
(anti-)invariant polynomial can be written in terms of monomials Ni as
X
X
Q0,+ =
ci Ni +
dj (Nj + σ(Nj ))
i

Q− =

X

j

dj (Nj − σ(Nj )), where σ(Ni ) = Ni and σ(Nj ) 6= Nj .

(19)

j

Thus, G0 ∪ G+ will only contain monomial and binomial generators, and G− only binomial
generators.
The unexchanged coordinates in G0 are known a priori from our choice of involution, so
we restrict our attention to finding the non-trivial even and odd parity generators in G+ and
G− . To do this, we must consider not only σ, but the 2n − 1 non-trivial “sub-involutions”
ρ ⊆ σ given by the non-empty subsets of {σ1 , ..., σn } of size 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
For m = 1, ρ ≡ σs : xis ↔ xjs , and it is clear that G+ = {xis xjs } and G− = ∅. Since
we are considering only exchanges of NIDs, we do not need to consider binomials (i.e.
xis ± xjs ) as these are not homogeneous.
For m > 1 sub-involutions, any invariant monomials are just products of the generators from m = 1 sub-involutions. Therefore, we will now turn our attention to binomial
generators. In particular, we look for those of the form
y± (a) = xai11 xai22 · · · xaimm ± xaj11 xaj22 · · · xajmm ,
5

(20)

Note, however, that while these hypersurfaces are not individually point-wise fixed, they do individually satisfy the involution condition with σ 2 ◦ f = f and σ 2 ◦ g = g.

12

where a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , am ) ∈ Zm are such as to ensure that the binomial is homogeneous. If
a contains negative entries, we simply multiply through by the necessary monomial factor
to clear any denominators and obtain a proper binomial. The condition for homogeneity,
in terms of the columns wis and wjs of the weight matrix W is given by
a1 wi1 + a2 wi2 + · · · am wim = a1 wj1 + a2 wj2 + · · · + am wjm ,

(21)

which we rewrite as
a1 (wi1 − wj1 ) + a2 (wi2 − wj2 ) + · · · + am (wim − wjm ) = 0 .

(22)

Let D be the matrix whose columns are the difference vectors ds = wis − wjs . The above
equality implies that a lies in ker D ∩ Zm . The generators of ker D ∩ Zm as a Z-module give
the exponents of binomial generators in G± , which we can see via the following argument:
Let a, b ∈ ker D ∩ Zm , with associated binomials y± (a) = A ± B, y± (b) = C ± D,
where A, B, C, D are monomials in the xi with σ(A) = B, σ(C) = D. Consider y+ (a + b)
at some fixed point of σ. We need only consider the region where no xi in these expressions
vanishes (if xi = 0 for some i, this point is already contained within the vanishing set of
xi xσ(i) ∈ G+ and thus would not be a new fixed point). In this region, the vanishing of
y+ (a + b) is equivalent to the vanishing of AC + BD. As y+ (a), y− (a) have the same
weights with opposite parity, at least one must vanish at every fixed point. Thus at our
fixed point we have A = ±B. As the same is true for y+ (b), y− (b), we also have C = ±D.
If A = B, C = −D or A = −B, C = D, then AC = −BD and AC + BD vanishes
trivially. Otherwise we have AC = BD, and AC+BD = 2AC. This vanishes iff A = B = 0
or C = D = 0, which as we noted earlier lies in the vanishing set of xi xσ(i) for some xi .
Hence any fixed points in the vanishing set of y+ (a + b) are contained within the vanishing
sets of y± (a), y± (b), or the monomial elements of G+ , and we need not consider it further.
A similar argument applies for y− (a + b).
We repeat this procedure for each sub-involution ρ ⊆ σ. The sets G± are given by the
union of the generators found for each of the sub-involutions.
2.4.3

Naive fixed point loci

We first perform a version of the Segre embedding,6 transforming the projective coordinates into the (anti-)invariant generators {x1 , ..., xk } 7→ {y1 , ..., yk0 } ≡ G. The cardinality
k 0 = |G| may be less than, equal to, or greater than k. We construct the weight matrix
W̃ for these generators by taking appropriate linear combinations of the original weight
matrix columns wi .
In order for a codimension-1 subvariety D ⊂ X to be point-wise fixed under the involution σ ∗ , the corresponding coordinate exchange must force its defining polynomial to
vanish, i.e. σ : y 7→ −y, so that D = {y = 0} is fixed. This implies that the defining
polynomial y of every point-wise fixed codimension-1 subvariety must be generated by
odd-parity generators in G− . In the case where G− is empty, there is no non-trivial fixed
subvariety. Then, naively, the only locus in the ambient space (if it exists) fixed under σ
is the set
{xi1 = xi2 = · · · = xin = xj1 = xj2 = · · · = xjn = 0},
6

A similar Segre embedding is used in the F-theory lifts from Type IIB orientifold models [79].

13

which is trivially unaffected by σ. However, when G− is non-empty, this trivial locus is
immediately a subspace of any generator y ∈ G− , and is therefore redundant.
To determine the point-wise fixed loci for codimension larger than one, we must check
whether the involution forces a subset of generators F ⊆ G to vanish simultaneously. The
number of checks required can be reduced by noting that if a locus is not point-wise fixed,
then no locus containing it will be either. For this reason, we consider only the subsets F
where F ∩ G− 6= ∅.
T
It would seem, then, that the
only
point-wise
fixed
locus
would
be
G
:=
y∈G− {y = 0}
T
while all other fixed loci F := y∈F {y = 0} correspond to the proper subsets F ( G− , and
are therefore redundant. However, it is important to note that the torus C∗ actions provide
r = rank(W̃) additional degrees of freedom for the generators to avoid being forced to zero.
That is, there may be a toric equivalence class that neutralizes the odd parity of some set
of generators, while adding odd parity to another set. In each subset of generators F, we
check for this by solving the system of equations
1i W̃2i
ri
λW̃
· · · λW̃
= σ(yi )/yi ,
1 λ2
r

i = 1, ..., k 0 .

(23)

By the construction of the generator yi , the right-hand side is equal to ±1. The set is
point-wise fixed if this equation is solvable in the λi .
Since the right-hand side of each of these equations has unit magnitude, we only need
to look for solutions with λi on the complex unit circle. As any element of the unit circle
can be written λi = eiπui with 0 ≤ ui < 2, each of the equations above can be rewritten as
a linear congruence in the x as

0 (mod 2), yi ∈ G0 ∪ G+
W̃1i u1 + · · · + W̃ri ur ≡
.
(24)
1 (mod 2), yi ∈ G−
We can rewrite this as a system of linear Diophantine equations as

0, yi ∈ G0 ∪ G+
W̃1i u1 + · · · + W̃ri ur − 2qi ≡
1, yi ∈ G−

(25)

for qi ∈ Z. The fact that 0 ≤ ui < 2 means that 0 ≤ qi < W̃1i + · · · + W̃ri , and thus
0
there are only a finite number of vectors q := (q1 , ..., qk0 ) ∈ Zk for which the solvability
of this linear system needs to be checked. This can easily be done using standard matrix
techniques. If the system has a solution u := (u1 , ..., ur ) ∈ Qr for any of the allowed q
vectors, then the set is point-wise fixed under σ.
One may notice that the generators we have defined above are not all entirely independent. For example, consider an involution σ : x1 ↔ x2 , x3 ↔ x4 such that we get
generators y1 = x1 x2 , y2 = x3 x4 , y3 = x1 x3 + x2 x4 , y4 = x1 x3 − x2 x4 . Then the generators
are related via the consistency condition y32 = y42 + 4y1 y2 . This manifests in a constraint on
the vanishing of the generators. For example, if y1 = y3 = 0, then y4 is necessarily equal to
zero. When scanning the subsets F of vanishing generators, we implement a consistency
check to filter out any spurious sets that violate these restrictions.
Before moving forward, it is important to note that it is indeed sufficient to consider
only the zero loci of the minimal generators, and not more general combinations. If we
have y1 , y2 ∈ G with zero loci D1 = {y1 = 0} and D2 = {y2 = 0}, the vanishing of the
14

product is simply the union of the two subvarieties {y1 y2 = 0} = D1 ∪ D2 . Thus, D1 ∪ D2
is only fixed when D1 and D2 are already fixed independently. We can also consider the
vanishing of the sum (or difference) {y1 + y2 = 0}, such that both y1 and y2 have the same
C∗ weights and the sum has definite parity. If either one vanishes, then both do, and the
resulting subvariety lies on D1 ∩ D2 , so that clearly both must be fixed independently for
their intersection to be fixed. Then, finally, we assume that neither generator vanishes.
Because σ acts as a homomorphism on the generators, the definite parity condition ensures
that y1 , y2 , and y1 + y2 must all have the same parity via

y1 + y2 , y1 , y2 ∈ G0 ∪ G+
σ(y1 + y2 ) = σ(y1 ) + σ(y2 ) =
.
(26)
−(y1 + y2 ), y1 , y2 ∈ G−
We saw above that determining whether or not a set is point-wise fixed under σ is dependent
only on its weights and parity, so y1 + y2 defines a fixed locus only if D1 and D2 are fixed
as well. The same argument applies to differences y1 − y2 .
2.4.4

Stanley-Reisner ideal and Calabi-Yau transversality

All of our calculations have thus far depended only on the toric weights, but eq.(14)
tells us that the ambient space A has a set of points Z ruled out by the Stanley-Reisner
(SR) ideal ISR . Now that we have found all possible point-wise fixed loci for each subset
of generators F, we must check that none of these lie in Z. ISR is defined as the squarefree ideal of non-intersections of toric divisors. For example, if D1 D2 ∈ ISR , then d12ij =
D1 · D2 · Di · Dj = 0 for all i, j = 1, ..., k. However, the concept works equally well with the
projective coordinates. One can say that if x1 x2 is in the SR ideal, then the simultaneously
vanishing set {x1 = x2 = 0} will not exist in A. As our fixed sets will often consist of
the zero loci of binomials, compatibility with the SR ideal cannot be generally read off in
this way. We check compatibility with the Stanley-Reisner ideal by expressing the ideal
and the generators as Boolean expressions. For each generator y ∈ G, we define a Boolean
variable Y whose value is True when y = 0.
To make this more clear, we give a few examples. The monomial y1 y2 , which is zero
when y1 = 0 or y2 = 0, is assigned the Boolean expression Y1 ∨Y2 . We build the expressions
for binomials from those of their constituent parts. For example, consider y1 y2 −y3 y4 . This
expression is zero if both y1 y2 and y3 y4 are zero, or if neither of them are (which means
that none of the individual yi = 0). We thus get the Boolean expression
y1 y2 − y3 y4 7→ [(Y1 ∨ Y2 ) ∧ (Y3 ∨ Y4 )] ∨ [(¬Y1 ) ∧ (¬Y2 ) ∧ (¬Y3 ) ∧ (¬Y4 )] .

(27)

By this iterative method, we can create the Boolean expression for any polynomial. Although tedious, this process is easily automated. Using this method, we create the expressions for the SR ideal and the polynomial generators. If these Boolean expressions
together form a contradiction, the fixed-point set does not intersect the Calabi-Yau and
is thus discarded. Unfortunately, this Boolean approach will not catch every case. In the
above example, if y1 y2 = y3 y4 6= 0, this method is insufficient and we need something more
robust. However, this first pass will rule out many spurious cases.
At least one coordinate in each element of the Stanley-Reisner ideal must be non-zero
at each point in A. By finding the minimal generating sets of coordinates that, when set
15

non-zero, satisfy this condition, we can split A up into disjoint regions Ui . In each of these
sectors, we implement this non-zero condition by setting the coordinates equal to unity.
By working in these sectors, we ensure that any remaining fixed sets that contradict the
SR ideal will be filtered out.
We now check whether each set can be restricted to the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. For
a given fixed set, we compute in each sector Ui the dimension of the ideal generated by
the Calabi-Yau polynomial Psymm and the fixed set generators F ≡ {y1 , ..., yp }
f ixed
Iip
= hUi , Psymm , y1 , ..., yp i .

(28)

f ixed
If the dimension dim Iip
< 0 for all Ui , then there is no Groebner basis, and we conclude
that this set does not intersect the CY hypersurface.
For each set that is not discarded, we repeat this calculation for the ideal with one fixed
f ixed
f ixed
f ixed
when
set generator dim Ii1
, and then two dim Ii2
, etc. until dim Ii`f ixed = dim Iip
adding more generators to the ideal no longer changes the dimension for any region Ui 7
Then, the intersection {y1 = · · · = y` = 0} of these generators gives the final point-wise
fixed locus, with redundancies eliminated. Since each generator is codimension-1 in X,
the length ` of this set of generators is the codimension in X of the fixed point locus.
An O3 plane corresponds to a codimension-3 point-wise fixed subvariey, an O5 plane has
codimension-2, an O7 plane has codimension-1, and an O9 plane has codimension-0 (which
means the entire CY is fixed under σ).

2.4.5

Smoothness

Finally, we check whether the invariant Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by Psymm is
smooth. This is important to determine whether an involution is a free action. We do this
by checking if there is any solution to the condition Psymm = dPsymm = 0 that is not ruled
out by the Stanley-Reisner ideal. In practice, this is done by setting up the ideals
Iismooth = hUi , Psymm ,

∂Psymm
∂Psymm
, ...,
i
∂x1
∂xk

(29)

for each region Ui allowed by the Stanley-Reisner ideal, and computing the dimension. If
dim Iismooth < 0 for all Ui , then the invariant Calabi-Yau hypersurface is smooth. If no
O-planes exist and the invariant Calabi-Yau hypersurface is smooth, then the involution
defines a Z2 free action on X.
2.4.6

Tadpole cancelation and string vacua

Since we are interested in the orientifold Type IIB string vacua, it is reasonable to
consider the possible tadpole cancelation in the O3/O7 system. In this paper we are not
concerned with the physics on the D7-branes and for the concrete orientifolds we will
7
Note that while this procedure will yield the correct dimension of the fixed point locus, it may occasionally overlook the existence of non-transversally intersecting generators. This may cause some points
to be falsely identified as fixed, but does not affect the overall dimension of the set. Since, however, this
will not lead to a misidentification of orientifold planes, a more thorough treatment will be left to future
work.

always cancel the D7-brane tadpole by simply placing eight D7-branes on top of the O7plane. Clearly, for concrete model building this simple assumption has to be relaxed. The
O7-planes and the D7-branes induce a D3-brane tadpole condition which simplifies to

total D3-brane charge Qloc
D3 of the seven-brane stacks and O3-planes to be an integer. It will
serve as a consistency check that this number is indeed an integer. If the involution passes
this naive tadpole cancellation check, we will denote our geometry as a “naive orientifold
Type IIB string vacua”. Of course, when an involution results in a geometry with only
O7-planes, it can automatically be classified as a naive string vacuum. The classification
of these orientifold involutions is summarized in Tables 3-6.

2.5

Hodge Number Splitting

The orientifold involution σ exchanges two projective coordinates on X. The holomorphicity condition requires that the pullback σ ∗ maps (p, q)-forms on X to (p, q)-forms.
This is also true at the level of cohomology as the Dolbeault operator ∂¯ commutes with the
pullback σ ∗ . This implies that in the orientifold limit, the dimensions of Hodge numbers
split as:
H p,q (X/σ ∗ ) = H+p,q (X/σ ∗ ) ⊕ H−p,q (X/σ ∗ ) .

(31)

Because we work only with favorable geometries, the calculations are simplified by the
fact that the toric classes of ambient space A always restrict in a straightforward way
to the Calabi-Yau hypersurface, and the divisor classes are the same, as shown in eq.(8).
∗
In order to determine the h1,1
± (X/σ ) splitting, we can always expand the Kähler form in
terms of these divisor classes.
To illustrate, we choose a toy example with h1,1 (X) = 3, admitting a proper orientifold
involution σ ∗ : D2 ↔ D3 . Suppose the divisor classes {D1 , D2 , D3 } form a basis for
H 1,1 (X; Z). Then, the Kähler form can be expanded as the linear combination
J = t1 J1 + t2 J2 + t3 J3 = t1 D1 + t2 D2 + t3 D3 ,

(32)

with t1 , t2 , t3 ∈ Z. But the Kähler form must obey the constraint of even parity under the
orientifold involution, and must therefore only have components in H+1,1 (X), so that
J = σ ∗ J = t1 D1 + t2 D3 + t3 D2 = t1 J1 + t3 J2 + t2 J3 .

(33)

Then, comparing eq.(32) and eq.(33), we note that we must have t2 = t3 = t+ , for some
t+ ∈ Z. Defining the even and odd parity eigendivisors D± = D2 ± D3 , we can write
J = t1 D1 + t+ D+ .

(34)

Thus, on the orientifold X/σ ∗ , there are only two independent directions in the Kähler
moduli space, D1 and D+ , while D− ∈ H−1,1 (X/σ ∗ ) does not appear in the Kähler form. We
17

1,1
∗
∗
therefore find the equivariant cohomology h1,1
+ (X/σ ) = 2 and h− (X/σ ) = 1. This can
8
only be done in a consistent way when σ is a proper involution respecting the linear ideal
Ilin , which addresses the redundancies among the toric divisor classes. Since the involution
exchanges pairs of NIDs, one can always expand the Kähler form in the orientifold-invariant
basis, depending on some pairs of the divisors involved in the involution.
In addition to the even and odd parity splitting of h1,1 (X/σ ∗ ), in principle we can apply
the Lefschetz fixed point theorem (for a brief introduction, see [80] and the Appendix
∗
of [81]) to determine the h2,1
− (X/σ ) in the Z2 -orbifold limit. In general the Z2 involution
σ induces a fixed-point set F. Due to the hodge number splitting eq.(31), we can define
the Leftschetz number of σ ∗ as L(σ ∗ , X):
X
L(σ ∗ , X) ≡
(−)i (bi+ − bi− ) = χ(F) ,
(35)
i

where bi± are the split Betti numbers and the the right-hand side is the Euler number of
the fixed locus F. There is a very useful theorem to calculate the Euler number of the
Z2 -orbifold space:
χ(X/σ ∗ ) =

 X
1
L(σ ∗ , X) + χ(X) =
(−)i (bi+ ),
2
i

(36)

which is the average of the Lefschetz number and the Euler number of X. For the divisor
exchange involution σ ∗ , we have further:9
1,1
∗
∗
h2,1
− (X/σ ) = h− (X/σ ) +

L(σ ∗ , X) − χ(X)

where


L(σ ∗ , X) = χ(F) ⊃
χ(O5) = O5 c1 (O5) ,

R

χ(O3) = O3 c0 (O3) = NO3 .

(38)

It is interesting to see that for an O3/O7-system with eight D7 on top of the O3-planes,
the Lefschetz number divided by 4 is exactly the Qloc
D3 in eq.(30) for tadpole cancellation.
∗
If the involution is a free action, L(σ , X) = 0 and eq.(36) reduces to the standard
form in which the Euler characteristic of a free action quotient group obeys χ(X/σ ∗ ) =
χ(X)/ |σ ∗ |, where |σ ∗ | = 2 is the order of the group action defined by σ ∗ ∼
= Z2 . These
results are enumerated in Table 6.
2,1
However, the full Hodge number such as h±
is only well-defined in the smooth case.
2,1
In the orbifold limit, h± may contain some ambiguity - for example, it may be negative or
fractional even when the tadpole cancellation is satisfied. So one can consider resolving the
8

In fact, in the case of a proper involution, it is extremely rare that we can write down an involution

Illustrative Examples of the Algorithm

In this section, we demonstrate three explicit examples of finding and classifying the
point-wise fixed sets of a Calabi-Yau orientifold, following the method described in the
previous section. The example in Section 3.1 has nonempty G+ , G− and demonstrates our
method in full. Additionally, the involution allows us to compute the split Hodge numbers
on the orientifold. The example in Section 3.2 demonstrates a potential free action which
has fixed points in the ambient space, but not on the Calabi-Yau hypersurface itself.
Finally, the example in Section 3.3 demonstrates the only proper, smooth, geometry-wide
free action found by our scan.

Proper Involution with O3 and O7 planes

Our first example is from the database of Calabi-Yau threefolds at www.rossealtman.

Although we will examine this example within the context of this particular triangulation,
this involution is valid in each chamber of this geometry’s Kähler cone. This example
defines an MPCP desingularized ambient toric variety with weight matrix W given by

and Stanley-Reisner (SR) ideal
ISR = hx1 x8 , x3 x7 , x4 x6 , x1 x4 x7 , x2 x3 x5 , x2 x5 x6 , x2 x5 x8 i.

(40)

The Hodge numbers of the corrsponding individual toric divisors Di ≡ {xi = 0} are
h• (D1 ) = {1, 0, 0, 9}
h• (D2 ) = h• (D4 ) = h• (D5 ) = h• (D7 ) = {1, 0, 1, 21}
h• (D3 ) = h• (D6 ) = {1, 0, 0, 12}
h• (D8 ) = {1, 0, 2, 30} .
19

(41)

For this example, there is only one proper involution exchanging NIDs, which leaves the
SR ideal together with Linear ideal invariant, and thereby intersection numbers invariant.
This proper NID involution is formed by exchanging two pair of coordinates:
σ : x3 ↔ x6 ,

x4 ↔ x7 .

(42)

From eq.(41) we see that this is an exchange of two dP9 divisors and two exact Wilson
divisors.
As is necessary for a consistent orientifold, the volume form eq.(12) has a definite parity
under σ. For completeness, we demonstrate our calculation of the parity. For this example,
the vector fields eq.(13) can be read off from the toric data eq.(39), and are:

Performing the contractions with ω is straightforward, and yields

− x2 x6 x7 x8 dx1 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx5 − x2 x4 x7 x8 dx1 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx6 − x2 x4 x6 x7 dx1 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx8
+ x2 x3 x6 x8 dx1 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx7 − x2 x3 x6 x7 dx1 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx8 + x2 x3 x4 x8 dx1 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx7
− x2 x3 x4 x7 dx1 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx8 − x2 x3 x4 x6 dx1 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx7 ∧ dx8 − x1 x6 x7 x8 dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx5
+ x1 x5 x6 x7 dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx8 − x1 x4 x7 x8 dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx6 − x1 x4 x5 x7 dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx8
+ x1 x3 x6 x8 dx2 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx7 + x1 x3 x5 x6 dx2 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx7 ∧ dx8 + x1 x3 x4 x8 dx2 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx7
− x1 x3 x4 x5 dx2 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx7 ∧ dx8 − x1 x2 x6 x7 dx3 ∧ dx4 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx8 − x1 x2 x4 x7 dx3 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx8
+ x1 x2 x3 x6 dx4 ∧ dx5 ∧ dx7 ∧ dx8 + x1 x2 x3 x4 dx5 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx7 ∧ dx8 .

With this explicit expression for Q in terms of the xi , we can find its image under
σ by exchanging {x3 ↔ x6 , x4 ↔ x7 ; dx2 ↔ dx4 , dx7 ↔ dx8 }. As an example, the
first term in Q is x5 x6 x7 x8 dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx4 . After applying σ, this term becomes
x3 x4 x5 x8 dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx6 ∧ dx7 . This is the negative of the first term in the fourth line
of the expression for Q above. These calculations, as well as the preceding contractions,
are tedious to perform but easily automated. We find that the resulting form is exactly
the negative of Q, and thus the volume form has odd parity under σ, i.e. σ ∗ Ω3 = − Ω3 .
So we would expect if there are any fixed points under the involution, it should be O3 or
O7-planes, or both.

20

Orientifold Planes
Since the projective coordinates x1 , x2 , x5 , and x8 are not affected by the involution,
they are included in our list of (anti-)invariant polynomial generators
G0 = {x1 , x2 , x5 , x8 } .

(44)

If we define σ1 : x3 ↔ x6 and σ2 : x4 ↔ x7 , such that σ = σ1 ◦ σ2 , then we have the three
sub-involutions: σ1 , σ2 , and σ. We now explore these cases:
1. σ1 : x3 ↔ x6
Because we only consider NIDs, x3 and x6 have different weights and cannot be
combined into a homogenous binomial. Thus, we are left only with the invariant
monomial x3 x6 .
⇒ G+ = {x3 x6 }, G− = ∅
2. σ2 : x4 ↔ x7
For the same reason, we are left only with the invariant monomial x4 x7 .
⇒ G+ = {x7 x8 }, G− = ∅
3. σ : x3 ↔ x6 , x4 ↔ x7
Any invariant monomials in this case are just products of the ones we found above.
However, we must now consider binomial generators of the form
n
m n
xm
3 x4 ± x6 x7

(45)

for m, n ∈ Z. The homogeneity of this binomial is determined by the following
condition on the weights
m(Wi3 − Wi4 ) + n(Wi6 − Wi7 ) = 0 .

(46)

Thus, the vector (m, n) ∈ Z2 lies in the kernel of the matrix of difference vectors
Wi2 − Wi4 Wi7 − Wi8
−1
1
1
−1
0
0
0
0

(47)

The kernel is generated by the vector (m, n) = (1, 1), so that our binomial generators10 are given by x3 x4 ± x6 x7 . This implies that G+ = {x3 x4 + x6 x7 } and
G− = {x3 x4 − x6 x7 }.
Note that all the (anti-)invariant polynomial generations in G = G0 ∪ G+ ∪ G− are given by
y1 = x1 , y2 = x2 , y3 = x5 , y4 = x8 , y5 = x3 x6 ,
y6 = x4 x7 , y7 = x3 x4 + x6 x7 , y8 = x3 x4 − x6 x7 .
10

(48)

Note that if the kernel was generated by (m, n) = (1, −1), then the binomial generators would be
−1
given by x3 x−1
4 ± x6 x7 . If we multiply through by x4 x7 , we get x3 x7 ± x4 x6 . This just implies that we
assumed the wrong positions of x4 and x7 , so they must be switched in the binomial.

This coordinate transformation defines the Segre embedding with consistency condition

(49)

However, this matrix only has rank 3, and is redundant. We see that row (3) = 2 × (2) −
3 × (1), so we eliminate this row
y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 y8
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 λ1
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 λ2
1 0 0 1 0 2 1 1 λ3

(50)

The involution σ can be rewritten simply in these coordinates as y8 7→ −y8 . Thus, we
see that F1 = {y8 = 0} is a point-wise fixed, codimension-1 subvariety. This defines an O7
plane on the orientifold of X. By inspecting eq.(42), we may, in addition, naively assume
the fixed point set F0 = {x3 = x4 = x6 = x7 = 0}, which is trivially unaffected by the
involution. However, F0 is a subset of F1 , and is therefore redundant. The redundancy of
this trivial fixed point set is a general feature of any involution which admits odd parity
binomial generators in G− .
By taking advantage of the toric degrees of freedom, however, there may be other
non-trivial fixed sets in addition to F1 . We therefore check whether any subset F of the
generators can neutralize the odd parity of y8 , becoming fixed themselves in the process.
This scan can be simplified by noting that if a set of points is not fixed, then neither is any
set containing it. Thus, if the simultaneous vanishing of a set of generators is not fixed,
then neither is the vanishing of any subset. We therefore begin our scan with the largest set
of generators and work our way down. The largest set we can choose has four generators,
since their simultaneous vanishing defines a set of isolated points on the ambient space A.
Consider the subset {y1 , y2 , y3 , y7 } ≡ F2 ⊂ G. In order for the locus F2 = {y1 = y2 =
y3 = y7 = 0} to be fixed, we must use the three independent C∗ actions to neutralize the
odd parity of y8 while leaving everything else invariant (as y8 is the only non-zero generator
with negative parity). This constraint is defined by the toric equivalence class
(y4 , y5 , y6 , −y8 ) ∼ (λ2 λ3 y4 , λ1 y5 , λ1 λ23 y6 , λ1 λ3 y8 )
= (y4 , y5 , y6 , y8 )

(51)

where λ1 , λ2 , λ3 ∈ C∗ . This can be written more simply as the system of multiplicative
equations
λ2 λ3 = 1
λ1 λ23 = 1

λ1 = 1
λ1 λ3 = −1 .

(52)

Simple inspection reveals that this system can clearly be solved with solution (λ1 , λ2 , λ3 ) =
(1, −1, −1), but we will continue with our algorithm, as the computer algorithm, following
22

our analysis in a systematic manner, would not be able to arrive at this conclusion at this
juncture.
By defining λ1 = eiπu , λ2 = eiπv , λ3 = eiπw as explicit values on the complex unit circle
with u, v, w ∈ Q, and noting that 0 ≤ u, v, w < 2 is the primitive domain of unique values,
we can replace the multiplicative equations with linear congruences
v + w ≡ 0 (mod 2)
u + 2w ≡ 0 (mod 2)

u≡0
u+w ≡1

(mod 2)
(mod 2) .

(53)

Finally, by adding in the auxiliary variables q1 , ..., q4 ∈ Z, we can write this as a linear
system of Diophantine equalities
v + w − 2q1 = 0
u + 2w − 2q7 = 0

u − 2q2 = 0
u + w − 2q8 = 1 .

(54)

Since 0 ≤ u, v, w < 2, we notice that the vector (q1 , ..., q4 ) ∈ Z4 is in the lattice Λ ⊂ Z4
defined by
0 ≤ q1 , q4 < 2
0 ≤ q2 < 1
0 ≤ q3 < 3 .
(55)
This gives us a finite range to scan over, and the search is relatively fast. For each point
(q1 , ..., q4 ) ∈ Λ, we search for a solution to eq.(54). If any solution is found for any lattice
point, then the set of generators F has a point-wise fixed vanishing locus. As we saw
earlier, this particular system can indeed be solved, and so F2 = {y1 = y2 = y3 = y7 = 0}
defines a point-wise fixed set. We do not find any additional point-wise fixed sets that are
not subsets of F1 and F2 .
We must now check that the fixed sets intersect the Calabi-Yau hypersurface transversally, so that they are not redundant. The orientifold-symmetric Calabi-Yau polynomial

23

has the form
Psymm = a1 x41 x32 x23 x26 + a2 x41 x22 x23 x5 x26 + a3 x41 x2 x23 x25 x26 + a4 x41 x23 x35 x26 + a5 x31 x32 x23 x4 x6

+ a48 x23 x4 x6 x38 + a48 x3 x26 x7 x38 .
(56)
The fixed point set F2 = {y1 = y2 = y3 = y7 = 0} can be written in terms of the
original projective coordinates {x1 = x2 = x5 = 0} ∩ {x3 x4 = −x6 x7 }. If we make these
substitutions in Psymm , it reduces to
Psymm = a48 (x23 x4 x6 x38 + x3 x26 x7 x38 )
= a48 x3 x6 x38 y7 .

(57)

As we are considering the subset where x1 = x2 = x5 = 0, and the Stanley-Reisner
ideal forbids x2 = x3 = x5 = 0, then x3 cannot vanish. Similarly, x2 = x5 = x6 = 0 is
forbidden and so x6 cannot vanish. Finally, x2 = x5 = x8 = 0 is forbidden, so x8 cannot
vanish. Thus, the only way for Psymm to vanish is to have y7 = 0.
Hence, Psymm = 0 implies y7 = 0 due to the SR constraints, and y8 is redundant when
restricting the fixed set to X. The reduced set is then F20 = {y1 = y2 = y3 = 0}.
In practice, we combine the transversality and SR ideal checks by performing Groebner
basis calculations to check the dimension of the ideal Iijf ixed as in eq.(28) for Ui a region
allowed by the Stanley-Reisner ideal.
Iijf ixed = hUi , Psymm , Fj i

(59)

for auxiliary variables t1 , ..., t8 ∈ C. In order to simplify the calculation, however, we set
t1 = ... = t8 = 1. If the dimension dim I > 0, and removing any generator from Fi changes
the dimension, then we know that Fi intersects X transversally and is allowed by the SR
ideal.
Finally, we can tell from the number of intersecting codimension-1 subvarieties in each
of the fixed sets F1 and F20 that they have complex codimension 1 and 3 in X respectively.
This implies that F1 is an O7 plane, while F20 is an O3 plane locus.
These fixed point sets intersect the respective σ-invariant hypersurface so that we get
a number of O7 and O3-planes. The homology class of the single O7 plane is
D(O7F1 ) = D3 + D4 ,

(60)

with Euler characteristic χ(D(O7)) = 39. In order to determine the number of O3-planes,
we can use the intersection form to compute the triple intersection numbers as
O3F20 : D1 D2 D5 = 1

(61)

so that in total there is one O3-plane. Using eq.(30) the contribution to the D3-brane

Calabi-Yau orientifold. The linear ideal, which fixes toric divisor redundancies, is given by

and a basis in H 1,1 (X; Z) is given by J1 = D4 , J2 = D5 , J3 = D6 , J4 = D8 .
By the definition of the holomorphic involution eq.(1), the Kähler form is even and
must therefore belong to H+1,1 (X/σ ∗ ) under the involution
σ ∗ : D3 ↔ D6 ,

D4 ↔ D7 .

(64)

In a case with favorable geometry, as in this example, the calculation is simplified by the
fact that the toric divisor classes of the ambient space A always restrict in a straightforward
way to the Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface via eq.(8). We can therefore expand the
Kähler form in terms of these divisor classes
J = t1 J1 + t2 J2 + t3 J3 + t4 J4 = t1 D5 + t2 D6 + t3 D7 + t4 D8

(65)

with t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 ∈ Z. But the Kähler form must obey the constraint of even parity under
the orientifold involution, and must therefore only have components in H+1,1 (X), so that
J = σ ∗ J = t1 D5 + t2 D3 + t3 D4 + t4 D8 = t1 J1 + t2 D3 + t3 D4 + t4 J4 .

(66)

In order to relate eq.(65) and eq.(66), we must be able to write D3 and D4 (restricted
8
P
to the CY hypersurface X =
Di ) in terms of our chosen basis. This can be done by
i=1

reducing D3 and D4 by the linear ideal Ilin (also restricted to the CY hypersurface). We
find that on X, D3 and D4 are uniquely given by11
D3 = J1 + J3 − J4

D4 = −J1 + J2 + J4 .

(67)

J = (t1 + t2 − t3 )J1 + t3 J2 + t2 J3 + (−t2 + t3 + t4 )J4 .

(68)

and

Plugging these into eq.(66), we deduce

Now, comparing eq.(65) and eq.(68), we obtain the following system of linear equations
t1 + t2 − t3 = t1 ,
t2 = t3 ,

t3 = t2 ,
−t2 + t3 + t4 = t4 ,

(69)

for which the only independent solution is t2 = t3 . Thus, we see that only 3 directions
∗
in the Kähler moduli space are independent, and so h1,1
+ (X/σ ) = 3, and by extension
∗
h1,1
− (X/σ ) = 1. This will be the case for any choice of integral basis on the Kähler moduli
space. In fact, choosing even and odd parity eigendivisors D±,1 = D3 ± D6 , D±,2 =
D4 ± D7 , the Kähler form can be written
J = (t1 − t2 )J1 + (t4 + t2 )J4 + t2 (D+,1 − D+,2 ) = (t1 − t+ )J1 + (t4 + t+ )J4 + t+ (D+ ) ,
(70)
where the latter equality makes the redefinitions t+ = t2 and D+ = D+,1 − D+,2 = (D3 +
D6 ) − (D4 + D7 ). The even parity of the Kähler form is now manifest. In this example,
the involution σ ∗ induces an O7 plane and an O3 plane, and so is not a free action and we
have the Hodge number splitting12

Improper Involution: Single Coordinate Exchange

In this section, we demonstrate an explicit example of a Calabi-Yau orientifold for
which an involution with a single coordinate exchange exists with an empty fixed-point
locus, which makes the involution a would-be free-action. However, this single coordinate
exchange will violate the Ilin and fails to keep the defining hypersurface polynomial homogenous. As discussed around eq.(7-9) this may fail to leave the the intersection numbers
invariant. This turns out to be a general feature of single coordinate exchange involutions
at low h1,1 (X), and we will see why that is. In fact, we do not begin to see proper fixed-point
free involutions until h1,1 (X) = 6 with upwards of four disjoint coordinate exchanges.
We have chosen an example from the database of Calabi-Yau threefolds with Hodge
numbers h1,1 (X) = 4, h2,1 (X) = 82. It can be identified by its index in the database:

and Stanley-Reisner ideal

For this example there is only one involution exchanging NIDs that leaves the SR
ideal invariant. However, it is not “proper”; it fails to leave the the intersection numbers
invariant. In the interest of keeping this example simple, we will carry on with this choice
of “improper” involution. This involution is given by
σ : x2 ↔ x5 .

(74)

Since the projective coordinates x1 , x3 , x4 , x6 , x7 , and x8 are not affected by the involution,
they are included in our list of (anti-)invariant polynomial generators
G0 = {x1 , x3 , x4 , x6 , x7 , x8 } .

(75)

In this case, there is only one sub-involution, σ itself. Because we only consider NIDs, x2
and x5 have different weights and cannot be combined into a homogenous binomial. Thus,
we are left only with the invariant monomial x2 x5 . This implies that the even and odd
parity generator sets are G+ = {x2 x5 } and G− = ∅.
Now, all the (anti-)invariant polynomial generations in G = G0 ∪ G+ ∪ G− are given by
y1 = x1 ,

y 2 = x3 ,

y3 = x4 ,

y4 = x6 ,
27

y5 = x 7 ,

y6 = x8 ,

y 7 = x2 x5 .

There are no generators with odd parity under the involution which are manifestly fixed. It
is for this reason that single coordinate exchange involutions are fixed-point free. Naively,
however, we may still have the fixed set F0 = {x2 = x5 = 0}. Note that this set is allowed
by the Stanley-Reisner ideal and does, in fact, exist in the ambient space. However, the
orientifold-symmetric Calabi-Yau polynomial has the form
Psymm = a1 x27 + a1 x21 x22 x44 x25 x6 x8 + a3 x41 x22 x23 x24 x25 x6 x38 + a4 x21 x22 x23 x24 x25 x26 x28 + a5 x31 x22 x3 x34 x25 x6 x28
+ a6 x51 x22 x33 x4 x25 x6 x48 + a7 x61 x22 x23 x24 x25 x48 + a8 x22 x43 x25 x46 x28 + a9 x2 x24 x5 x6 x7
+ a10 x21 x2 x24 x5 x7 x8 + a11 x31 x2 x3 x4 x5 x7 x28 + a12 x51 x22 x3 x34 x25 x38 + a13 x81 x22 x43 x25 x68
+ a14 x61 x22 x43 x25 x6 x58 + a15 x41 x22 x44 x25 x28 + a16 x41 x2 x23 x5 x7 x38 + a17 x71 x22 x33 x4 x25 x58
+ a18 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 + a19 x1 x22 x3 x34 x25 x26 x8 + a20 x1 x22 x33 x4 x25 x36 x28 + a21 x31 x22 x33 x4 x25 x26 x38
+ a22 x2 x23 x5 x26 x7 x8 + a23 x21 x2 x23 x5 x6 x7 x28 + a24 x41 x22 x43 x25 x26 x48 + a25 x22 x23 x24 x25 x36 x8
+ a26 x21 x22 x43 x25 x36 x38 + a27 x22 x44 x25 x26 ,
where ai ∈ C are arbitrary coefficients. On the ambient space fixed set, where {x2 = x5 =
0}, this reduces simply to
Psymm = a1 x27 .

(76)

Thus, the vanishing with the Calabi-Yau polynomial on this set is equivalent to the vanishing of x7 . However, as x2 x5 x7 is an element of the Stanley-Reisner ideal, x7 cannot vanish
on this set. Hence, the region where the Calabi-Yau hypersurface intersects the fixed-point
locus of the ambient space is ruled out, giving us what is potentially a free action on the
orientifold, provided that it is also non-singular by checking the dimension of ideal Iismooth
eq.(29) for each disjoint region Ui allowed by the Stanley-Reisner ideal.
We now turn to the procedure for computing the splitting of the Hodge numbers on the
Calabi-Yau orientifold. The linear ideal, which fixes toric divisor redundancies, is given by
Ilin = h −D1

As we saw before, x2 and x5 have different weights and cannot be combined into a homogenous binomial. So we only need to consider the coordinate exchange x2 ↔ x5 in
the defining polynomial of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. The involution fails to keep the
defining polynomial homogeneous without tuning any coefficients to zero. For example
the monomial x4 x25 x26 x7 in the original defining polynomial with degree ||6, 6, 4, 10|| will be
changed to monomial x4 x22 x26 x7 with degree ||6, 2, 4, 14|| after the involution. This violates
the linear ideal Ilin and it is also the reason why the triple intersection number changes
under such an involution.

Free Action Involution

In this section, we demonstrate an explicit example of a Calabi-Yau orientifold for
which the involution is a free action. Additionally, this is the sole example we found in
28

which the resulting orientifold is smooth. This example has Hodge numbers h1,1 (X) =
6, h2,1 (X) = 46. It can be identified by its index in the database

(79)

and all toric divisors have the same Hodge numbers, h• (Di ) = {1, 0, 0, 11}. In fact, this
example is the only one which leads to a free action involving five coordinate exchanges,
and is given by
σ : x1 ↔ x10 , x2 ↔ x9 , x3 ↔ x8 , x4 ↔ x7 , x5 ↔ x6 .

(80)

Orientifold Planes
This involution eq.(80) affects all ten projective coordinates, and thus G0 = ∅. Computing the (anti-)invariant polynomials, we find the following:
G+ ={x1 x10 , x2 x9 , x3 x8 , x4 x7 , x5 x6 , x1 x2 + x9 x10 , x1 x3 + x8 x10 ,
x1 x6 + x5 x10 , x1 x7 + x4 x10 , x2 x8 + x3 x9 , x2 x4 + x7 x9 , x2 x5 + x6 x9 ,
x3 x4 + x7 x8 , x3 x5 + x6 x8 , x4 x6 + x5 x7 },

(81)

G− ={x1 x2 − x9 x10 , x1 x3 − x8 x10 , x1 x6 − x5 x10 , x1 x7 − x4 x10 ,
x2 x8 − x3 x9 , x2 x4 − x7 x9 , x2 x5 − x6 x9 , x3 x4 − x7 x8 , x3 x5 − x6 x8
, x4 x6 − x5 x7 }.

(82)

We note that all of the monomial elements of G+ are also members of the StanleyReisner ideal. As all of these monomials have the form xi xσ(i) , they thus cannot vanish in
the ambient space. Also, recall that for our pairs of binomial generators, at least one must
29

vanish at any fixed point as the expressions have the same weights but opposite parity.
(For example, for this involution at least one of x1 x2 ± x9 x10 must vanish at any fixed
point).
This means that there are 210 possible fixed sets, corresponding to a sign choice in each
of the 10 pairs of binomial generators. Scanning over these sets, there are many choices
whose weights allow them to be fixed. However, all of these choices lead to sets which fail
to intersect the ambient space due to the coordinate restrictions imposed by the StanleyReisner ideal. Since this involution is indeed a free action, there is no fixed locus and
therefore no O-plane. This manifold can also be considered as one of the “naive orientifold
Type IIB string vacua”.
Hodge Splitting
We now turn to the procedure for computing the splitting of the Hodge numbers on the
Calabi-Yau orientifold. The linear ideal, which fixes toric divisor redundancies, is given by

and a basis in H 1,1 (X; Z) is given by J1 = D5 , J2 = D6 , J3 = D7 , J4 = D8 , J5 = D9 , J6 =
D10 . In this example the involution acts on the divisor classes as
σ ∗ : D1 ↔ D10 , D2 ↔ D9 , D3 ↔ D8 , D4 ↔ D7 , D5 ↔ D6 ,

(84)

thus all five of the exchanges in this example are of non-shrinkable rigid divisors. This
case is favorable, and we can thus expand the Kähler form in terms of these divisor classes
J = t1 J1 + t2 J2 + t3 J3 + t4 J4 + t5 J5 + t6 J6 , with t1 , ...t6 ∈ Z. The constraint that the Kähler
form must only have components in H+1,1 (X) implies
J = σ ∗ J = t1 D6 + t2 D5 + t3 D4 + t4 D3 + t5 D2 + t6 D1

(85)

As in previous examples, we rewrite D1 , D2 , D3 , and D4 in terms of our chosen basis
using the linear ideal. Performing the algebra, and plugging the relations into eq.(85), we
obtain
J = (t2 + t3 − t4 − t5 + t6 )J1 + (t1 − t3 + t4 + t5 − t6 )J2 + t3 J3 + t4 J4 + t5 J5 + t6 J6 . (86)
Note that the last four terms are unchanged from the original expansion of the Kähler
form and we get
t2 + t3 − t4 − t5 + t6 = t1 ,

t1 − t3 + t4 + t5 − t6 = t2 .

(87)

Solving for t1 in the latter equation shows that these are in fact the same, and hence
∗
we can write either t1 or t2 in terms of the other Kähler moduli. Hence h1,1
+ (X/σ ) = 5
1,1
∗
and h− (X/σ ) = 1. Choosing the independent even-parity eigendivisors D1+, = D5 +
D6 , D+,2 = D4 + D7 , D+,3 = D3 + D8 , D+,4 = D2 + D9 , D+,5 = D1 + D10 , we can write the
Kähler form in the manifestly even-parity form
J = t+,1 D+,1 + t+,2 D+,2 + t+,3 D+,3 + t+,4 D+,4 + t+,5 D+,5 ,
30

(88)

with coefficients t+,i given by
1

t+,1 = t1 + (−t3 + t4 + t5 − t6 ), t+,2 = t3 ,
2
2
1
1
1
t+,3 = t4 , t+,4 = t5 , t+,5 = t6 .
2
2
2

(89)

Finally we check whether the locus {Psymm = 0} is smooth by computing the dimension
dim Iismooth as eq.(29) for each disjoint region Ui allowed by the Stanley-Reisner ideal. We
find that the maximum dimension is −1, so that {Psymm = 0} is smooth. The involution
considered in eq.(80) is indeed a free action. Furthermore, the Hodge number splits under
the Lefschetz fixed point theorem:
1,1
∗
∗
h2,1
− (X/σ ) = h− (X/σ ) +

χ(X)
L(σ, X) − χ(X)
1,1
= h−

= 21 ,

(90)

and then the Hodge number of this smooth Calabi-Yau threefold splits as:
1,1
2,1
2,1
∗
∗
∗
∗
h1,1
+ (X/σ ) = 5, h− (X/σ ) = 1; h+ (X/σ ) = 25, h− (X/σ ) = 21 .

(91)

∗
Since the manifold is smooth, there is no ambiguity in defining h2,1
− (X/σ ) and eq.(37)
gives the true Hodge number splitting.

Scanning Results

In a systematic scan within the database [2] up to h1,1 = 6, we analyzed 22,974 favorable polytopes, from which we obtain 646,903 MPCP triangulations. As discussed in
Section 2.1, some subset of the triangulations of a dual polytope encode identical topological information, with the primary difference being the content of the Kähler cone.
In such cases, we must glue them together into a larger Kähler cone corresponding to a
single Calabi-Yau geometry. This gluing results in 100,368 distinct favorable Calabi-Yau
geometries. However, due to computational restraints, we were unable to examine every
triangulation. The percentages of geometries scanned are shown in Table.1.

Classification of Proper Involutions

According to the definition of orientifold projection eq.(1), each of the proper involutions will lead to an orientifold Calabi-Yau threefold. As a result, we will classify various
properties of orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds in the Z2 orbifold limit according to different
kinds of proper involutions.
We first consider the so-called “triangulation-wise” involutions. In Section 2.3, we
outline the procedure for obtaining the desired Non-trivial Identical Divisor (NID) involutions. In total, we find 107,171 such involutions present at the triangulation level which
exist within a single chamber of the Kähler cone of a given geometry. Of these, after considering the favorable triangulations and trivial fundamental group, 28,463 are “proper”
in the sense that they preserve the intersection structure of X and allow for consistent
orientifold geometries as described in Section 2.3. We also find that 8,449 favorable CY
geometries admit a consistent involution within at least one chamber of their Kähler cones.
These 28,463 triangulation-wise proper involutions are distributed in 25,375 different triangulations.
After considering the gluing of Kähler cones corresponding to a single Calabi-Yau geometry, we refer to those involutions which span all disjoint phases of the Kähler cone
for a unique Calabi-Yau geometry as “geometry-wise” proper NID involutions. We find a
total of 5,660 geometry-wise proper involutions, each of which may correspond to several
triangulation-wise involutions. We find that there are only 1,401 favorable polytopes and
4,482 favorable geometries which contain a geometry-wise proper NID involution, which account for 6.1% and 4.47% of scanned polytopes and geometries respectively. These results
are summarized in Table.2.
Each of the geometry-wise proper NID involutions may exchange several pairs of topologically distingushed divisors. Thus we enumerate the number of different pairs of Nontrivial Identical Divisors for each of the involutions as shown in Table 3. We note that it
is very rare for an involution to exchange both del Pezzo, K3, and exact-Wilson divisors
simultaneously for small h1,1 (X).
As an example, consider h1,1 (X) = 2. There are 36 polytopes which contains 48
MPCP triangulations. After gluing the Kähler cone of several triangulations with the
same topology, we end up with 39 distinguished Calabi-Yau manifolds (Table 1). Among
them only one polytope, which contains a single triangulation, (and thereby corresponds
to a single geometry) contains a proper involution (which is both a triangulation-wise and
geometry-wise involution). In fact, there are 6 different kinds of involutions acting on the
geometry which result in 6 different orientifold Calabi-Yau manifolds (Table 2). Each of
these 6 involutions exchanges three pairs of Special Deformation (SD2) divisors, which
results in a total of 18 exchanged pairs of SD2 surfaces (Table 3).

4.2

Classification of O-planes

The fixed points of the involution correspond to orientifold planes, which acquire
charges that must be cancelled by appropriate configurations of D3 and D7 branes in
order to avoid anomalies in our theory. We scan for these orientifold planes in Section 2.4
by seeking the fixed points in the ambient toric manifold and restricting down to components transversal with the involution-invariant part of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. Note

than in all but one case, the fixed sets allowed by a geometry-wise proper involution across
an entire consistent CY geometry are either individual O3, O5, or O7 planes, or combinations of O3 and O7 planes. In one case, discussed in Section 3.3, we find a freely acting Z2
involution. In every case, the parity of the volume form under σ is in agreement with the
orientifold planes found by our algorithm, i.e, σ ∗ Ω = −Ω for O3, O7, and O3/O7 cases,
and σ ∗ Ω = Ω for O5 cases. The results of this scan can be found in Table 4.13 It shows
that 23,961 out of the total 28,430 (84.3% of) triangulation-wise proper involutions and
4,108 out of the total 5,660 (72.6%) geometry-wise proper involutions will end up with an
orientifold Calabi-Yau threefold with an O3/O7-plane system.
As a consistency check, we note that there are no simultaneous O3 and O5-planes
existing under a single involution, as well as no O7 and O5-planes coexisting. Of course, it
then follows that there are no instances of an orientifold Calabi-Yau threefold containing
O3, O5 and O7-plane under a single involution.
We note that our results (in particular, only finding one free action) are in agreement
13

For h1,1 (X) = 6, due to the calculation time limit, we did not obtain the fixed loci for 33 triangulationwise involutions, which account for 0.14% of the 23805 triangulation-wise proper involutions in h1,1 (X) = 6.
So to classify O-planes and naive Type IIB string vacua (Tables 4, 5), we only take into account the 23772
triangulation-wise involutions for h1,1 (X) = 6.

with [70]. In that work, a search for freely-acting discrete symmetries of a more general
variety was performed for h1,1 (X) ≤ 3, with free actions being found for five toric CalabiYaus. Of these five, two do not admit any Z2 symmetries, while the Z2 symmetries of the
other three consist entirely of coordinate reflections of the form xi ↔ −xi . In particular,
none of these cases support an NID involution. This is consistent with our results, which
34

found no NID involutions below h1,1 (X) = 6.
As an example, consider h1,1 (X) = 3. There are 25 polytopes with 31 triangulations
containing 51 triangulation-wise proper involutions. Among these involutions, 9, 20 and
31 will result in O3, O5 and O7-plane loci respectively. Among them, there are 9 involutions which contain both O3- and O7- planes simultaneously. These 51 triangulation-wise
involutions reduce to 28 geometry-wise proper involutions when requiring the involution
span all disjoint phases of the Kähler cone for a unique Calabi-Yau geometry. In these 28
involutions, 4 contain O3 loci, 16 contain O5 loci, 12 contain O7 loci, while 4 contain a
combination of O3 and O7-planes (Table 4).

String Landscape

Under the assumption of placing eight D7-branes on top of the O7-plane to cancel the
D7-tadpole, we also count the naive orientifold Type IIB string vacua with an O3/O7system by considering cases that satisfy D3-tadpole cancellation, i.e, Qloc
D3 in eq.(30) is an
integer. If under an involution there is only an O7-plane involved, we just count it as one
naive Type IIB string vacuum. It turns out that for most of the Calabi-Yau threefolds
admitting a proper involution, they will end up with an O3/O7-system and obtain a naive
orientifold Type IIB string vacua. The results are summarized in Table 5. It shows that
35

20,715 (72.9%) of triangulation-wise proper involutions and 3,334 (58.9%) of geometry-wise
proper involutions result in a naive Type IIB string vacuum.
In the O5/O9-system, if we take account that the D5-tadpole is cancelled automatically
by the involution, in principle we can count all the configurations with O5 as naive string
vacua also. Then 25,183 (88.6% of) triangulation-wise proper involutions and 4,879 (86.2%)
of geometry-wise involutions will end up with a naive type IIB string vacuum. We did not
count these vacua in the present work.
For example, for h1,1 (X) = 3 there are 51 triangulation-wise and 28 geometry-wise
involutions, respectively. Under the triangulation-wise involutions, there are 9 orientifold
geometries containing both O3 and O7-planes which satisfy the naive D3-tadpole cancellation. There are 22 geometries containing only O7-planes and, as explained before, we
take all of them as naive string vacua. In total there are 31 naive string vacua among the
triangulation-wise involutions. Similarly, among the geometry-wise involutions, there are
four Calabi-Yau threefolds with O3/O7-planes and eight Calabi-Yau threefolds with only
O7-planes which satisfy the D3-tadople cancellation condition, adding up to a total of 12
naive orientifold Type IIB string vacua (Table 5).

Table 5: Classification of naive orientifold Type IIB string vacua under the
triangulation/geometry-wise proper involutions.
For those 20,715 triangulation-wise and 3,334 geometry-wise naive orientifold Tyep IIB
string vacua with an O3/O7-system, the distribution of Qloc
D3 is shown in Fig. 1. It shows
that most of the involutions end up with an orientifold Calabi-Yau threefold with Qloc
D3
around −8 in our scan. Again, the geometry-wise involutions put a strong constraint on
the geometry and reduce dramatically the number of possible geometries. Here we again
36

see that Qloc
D3 is generally around −8. For triangulation-wise involutions, the smallest and
loc
largest QD3 are −30 and 3 respectively, while for geometry-wise involutions, the range of
integer Qloc
D3 shrinks to [−30, 0].

Hodge Number Splitting

Finally, in Section 2.5, we discuss the decomposition of the Kähler moduli space into
odd and even parity equivariant cohomology H 1,1 (X/σ ∗ ) = H+1,1 (X/σ ∗ )⊕H−1,1 (X/σ ∗ ). The
constraint that the Kähler form must be invariant σ ∗ J = J ensures that we can always
find the dimension of the even parity space, and then by deduction, the dimension of the
∗
odd party space h1,1
− (X/σ ), which, as has been discussed, must be non-trivial in our case.
The results of this Kähler moduli space splitting can be found in Table 6. By utilizing the
∗
Lefschetz fixed point theorem eq.(37) we can further determine the h2,1
± (X/σ ) splitting
2,1
in the orbifold limit. The value of h±
(X/σ ∗ ) may get changed by a possible conifold
1,1
1,1
resolution while h− (X/σ ∗ ) is robust. In this paper, we only present the robust h−
(X/σ ∗ )
2,1
∗
results and leave the results of h± (X/σ ) after blowing up the singularities for a future
work. The entire procedure is explicitly performed in Section 3. As an example, for
h1,1 (X) = 3 there are 51 triangulation-wise and 28 geometry-wise involutions, respectively.
Under these involutions, the Hodge numbers of the orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds all
∗
split with h1,1
− (X/σ ) = 1.

Conclusions and Outlook

In this paper, we extend and improve on a previous study [1] of the database [2]
(www.rossealtman.com/tcy) of Calabi-Yau threefolds with h1,1 (X) ≤ 6, by asking for the
existence of a holomorphic Z2 orientifold involution σ. First, we determined the topology
of each divisor in defining the Calabi-Yau threefold by calculating its Hodge diamond.
By requiring that the pullback of σ to cohomology classes exchange only toric divisors
with identical surface topology, but separate cohomology on the Calabi-Yau, we ensure
1,1
that the orientifold has non-trivial odd equivariant cohomology h−
(X/σ ∗ ) 6= 0. We also

proper involutions.
classified the different kinds of Non-trivial Identical Divisors for each of the involutions and
showed that consistency of this involution across the full Kähler cone is very restrictive. We
further determined all possible fixed-point loci, i.e, the locations of O3, O5 and O7-planes,
for each of the proper involutions. By checking the D3 tadpole cancellation condition, a
class of naive Type IIB string vacua with O3/O7-system was obtained. We found that
under the proper involutions one ends up with a majority of O3/O7-planes systems, most
of which further admit a naive Type IIB string vacuum. Moreover, one free action was
identified. We further calculated the Hodge number splitting to even/odd cohomology
in the orbifold limit. This dataset of orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds, with all possible
proper divisor exchange involutions, the classification and counts of orientifold planes under
the involution, together with the non-trivial Hodge number splitting in the orbifold limit,
represent a rich phenomenological starting point for the construction of concrete string
models for both particle physics and cosmology.
In this paper we considered only involutions of type σ ∗ J = J, which result in Type IIB
string vacua. A natural extension is to consider anti-holomorphic involutions σ ∗ J = − J to
classify the Type IIA vacua. We leave examination of these involutions to a future work.
As discussed in the Introduction, although reflections xi ↔ −xi will in general not generate
non-trivial h1,1
− (X) in a favorable geomtry, it might still be very interesting to classify their
point-wise fixed loci and free actions on the Calabi-Yau hypersurface under the reflection.
38

This will lead to a primary classification of the Type II string vacua landscape of the
Kreuzer-Skarke database in our upcoming work [84].
Additionally, it would be ideal to extend these analyses beyond our current computational limit into the region h1,1 (X) ≥ 7 of the Kreuzer-Skarke database. There has recently
been progress on the triangulation of polytopes with large h1,1 (X) [55, 60, 85], although
limitations on these techniques still preclude examining all possible MPCP triangulations
for a general given polytope. Due to the large size of the Kreuzer-Skarke database, it is
therefore natural to expect that in addition to the formal progress, supervised machine
learning techniques will be necessary to understand the landscape, an approach applied to
counting MPCP triangulations in [86]. We will explore applying machine learning techniques to orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds under divisor exchange involutions in a coming
work [87].
In this paper, we focused on orientifold Calabi-Yaus under an involution without resolving the singularity, i.e, in the Z2 orbifold limit, which is mostly considered in the literature
for string model building. For other string applications, we can consider the resolution
of the conifold singularities as considered early in the CICY case [88, 89] and recently in
the CICY landscape [63, 64]. This will yield sets of CY threefolds that can be reached via
conifold transitions, and possibly result in some new threefolds beyond the Kreuzer-Skarke
list. We leave the resolution of conifold singularity for a future work.
Besides the Kreuzer-Skarke and CICY database, it was found that one can relax the
condition that the configuration matrix or weighted matrix entries be non-negative to
construct a new class of Calabi-Yau manifold, called “generalized Complete Intersection
Calabi-Yau” (gCICYs) [90] and its toric variations [91,92]. Some new mathematical aspects
[93–95] and physical applications [96, 97] of these geometries have recently been studied.
Examining involutive, or more general quotient, symmetries of these new manifolds as well
could prove interesting.

Pseudocode Description of Fixed-Point Algorithm

In this appendix we provide a pseudocode description of the fixed point classification
algorithm described in Section 2.4. The input consists of a proper NID exchange involution
σ for a CY hypersurface X in a toric variety A described by a fine, regular, star triangulation of a reflexive 4d polytope ∆◦ . The output is the set of fixed loci together with
their codimensionality (classification into O7, O5, O3). We focus only on the calculations
specific to this procedure, ignoring well-known procedures like finding the kernel or rank

39

of a matrix. In addition, we have favored algorithmic simplicity over optimization in our
descriptions of these algorithms.
The first calculation we describe is finding monomials with definite parity under the
involution. This process is described in the routine below. The input is σ, which for
these calculations can be expressed as a list of pairs, with each pair being the indices of
exchanged coordinates, along with the resolved weight matrix W . The output is the sets
G0 , G+ , G− of invariant monomials.

The next procedure describes the check to determine whether or not the toric weights
allow a locus, defined by the vanising of a list of homogeneous polynomials F, to be fixed.
As noted in Section 2.4, this is trivially true if F ∩ G− = ∅ and so such cases need not be
checked.
Algorithm 2: WEIGHT FIXED(F, W, G0 , G+ , G− )
m = W.rows
n = F.length
let M be a matrix of size m × n
for i ← 0 to n do
set column i of M to be the toric weight vector of F[i]
let b be an array of zeros of size n
for i ← 0 to n do
if F[i] ∈ G− then
b[i] = 1
let s be an array of size n
for i ← 0 to n do
s[i] = M1i + · · · + Mmi
let Q be the set Q = {(q1 , . . . , qn ) ∈ Zn , 0 ≤ qi < s[i]}
r = rank(M)
for q ∈ Q do
let Maug be the augmented matrix M |(2q + b)
raug = rank(Maug )
if r == raug then
return true
return false

As discussed in Section 2.4, the invariant generators are not independent, with some
subset of the generators being related by consistency conditions. The following algorithm
determines whether or not a given the fixed set determined by the vanishing of a list of
homogeneous polynomials F is consistent. We do this by computing the dimension of an
ideal with the nonvanishing invariant polynomials set to 1.
Algorithm 3: CONSISTENT(F, G0 , G+ , G− )
G = G0 ∪ G+ ∪ G−
let L be an empty list
for p ∈ G do
if p ∈ F then
append p to L
else
append p − 1 to L
return dim(hLi) ≥ 0

Thus, given the sets G0 , G+ , G− of definite-parity polynomials, we can find all fixed-point
loci allowed by the toric weights via the following routine.

42

Algorithm 4: FIXED LOCI WEIGHTS(W, G0 , G+ , G− )
G = G0 ∪ G+ ∪ G−
let L be an empty list
let S be the power set of G
for F ∈ S do
skip = false
for T ∈ L do
if T ⊂ S then
skip = true
break
if skip then
continue
if CONSISTENT(F, G0 , G+ , G− ) and WEIGHT FIXED(F, W, G0 , G+ , G− ) then
append F to L
return L

In order to check whether any given locus in the weighted projective space intersects
the ambient space, we first determine the minimal generating sets such that, when each
coordinate in a set is non-zero, the Stanley-Reisner conditions are satisfied. We call these
sets sectors. In a sense, this finds a minimal list of sets that cover the ambient space.
We express the Stanley-Reisner ideal ISR as a list of lists of integers. For example, if
x0 x2 x3 ∈ ISR , we have a list element {0, 2, 3}.
Given ISR , we can find the sectors using the following routine. Depending on one’s
chosen programming language, removing an element from a container mid-loop may invalidate iterators. Thus it may be safer to keep an auxiliary array of the indices of elements
to be removed, and then run a separate loop after to remove these elements.

43

Algorithm 5: SECTORS(ISR )
n = ISR .length
let S be the power set of {0, ..., n − 1}
/* Keep only index sets that contain at least one element
/* from each list in ISR
let T be an empty list
for S ∈ S do
keep = true
for j ← 0 to n − 1 do
if S ∩ ISR [j] == ∅ then
keep = false
break

*/
*/

if keep then
append S to T
/* Remove any lists that are supersets of others
for T1 ∈ T do
for T2 ∈ T do
if T1 ⊂ T2 then
remove T2 from T

*/

/* Construct the polynomials corresponding to the sectors
let U be an empty list
for T ∈ T do
let L be an empty list
for i ∈ T do
append xi − 1 to L
append L to U
return U

*/

The Calabi-Yau hypersurface X is defined by the vanishing of a homogeneous polynomial P . In order for X to be invariant under σ, we must restrict to the subset of moduli
space in which P is invariant. This gives us a “symmetrized” polynomial Ps . The requisite
steps for creating Ps are described in Section 2.4.1.
Once the sectors U and the homogeneous hypersurface polynomial Ps have been determined, we can check whether a given fixed locus defined by the vanishing of a list of
homogeneous polynomials F intersects that ambient space, by verifying that it intersects
at least one of the sectors. At the same time, we check that the set intersects the hypersurface, defined by Ps = 0. This is done via the following routine, which also returns the
ideal dimensions in the case that the intersection is nonempty, as these will be useful in
finding the codimension.

44

Algorithm 6: INTERSECTS HYPERSURFACE(F, U, Ps )
/* Check whether or not F intersects X in at least one sector
let D be an empty list
intersect ← false
for U ∈ U do
I = hU, Ps , Fi
d = dimI
if d ≥ 0 then
intersect = true
append d to D
return intersect, D

*/

Once we have determined that a fixed locus meets the hypersurface, we calculate its
codimension using the following routine. Note that the outermost for loop will, at worst,
terminate in its final iteration (when S is equal to F). To save calculation time, one can
check whether S.length == F.length before the inner for loop, and return the value beforehand if so. We have omitted this check for algorithmic clarity.
Algorithm 7: CODIMENSION(F, U, Ps , D)
let S be the power set of F, as a list
sort S in order of increasing set size
for i ← 0 to S.length do
same ← true
S = S[i]
for j ← 0 to U.length do
I = hU[j], Ps , S, i
ds = dimI
if ds 6= D[j] then
same = false
if same then
codim = 9 − 2 ∗ S.length
return codim

The final check is whether the σ-invariant hypersurface defined by the vanishing of Ps
is smooth. We do this by checking whether the polynomial and its partial derivatives can
all vanishing simultaneously, via the following algorithm.
Algorithm 8: SMOOTH(Ps , U)
smooth ← true
for U ∈ U do
∂Ps
s
Ismooth = hU, Ps , ∂P

return smooth

Combining these routines, we can express our full algorithm for determining the fixedpoint loci, their codimensions, and whether or not the hypersurface is smooth. The full
algorithm is sketched below. The input consists of the involution σ, the Stanley-Reisner
45

ideal ISR , the hypersurface polynomial P and the weight matrix W . The algorithm is
given below.
Algorithm 9: FIXED LOCI(σ, ISR , Ps , W )
G0 , G+ , G− = INVARIANT GENERATORS(σ, W )
G = G0 ∪ G+ ∪ G−
U = SECTORS(ISR )
let LF , Lc , Ls be empty lists
let S be the power set of G
for F ∈ S do
if FIXED LOCI WEIGHTS(W, G0 , G+ , G− ) then
X, D ← INTERSECTS HYPERSURFACE(F, U, Ps )
if X then
append F to LF
append CODIMENSION(F, U, Ps , D) to Lc
append SMOOTH(Ps , U) to Ls
return LF , Lc , Ls

Database Format of Results

In this appendix we describe the format in which the results of this scan will be stored
in the database located at www.rossealtman.com/tcy. The cohomology of each divisors
(Hodge diamond) in defining the Calabi-Yau are also presented. A thorough description
of the general structure and other contents of this website can be found in Section 3 of [2].

B.1

Database Fields

The entry for each involution will contain the following fields:
• Polytope #, Geometry #, Triangulation #: Identification numbers for the
polytope, geometry (within the polytope), and triangulation (within the geometry),
inherited from the existing database.
• Involution #: An identification number for the involution (within the triangulation)
• h11, h21: The Hodge numbers h1,1 and h2,1 of the polytope
• Invol: The involution, written in terms of its exchanged divisors, in a Mathematicastyle list
• Geometry-wise Invol: Whether the involution is Geometry-wise proper involution
• Volume Parity: The parity of the volume form under the involution (0 if the parity
is not definite)
• # Sym CY Terms: The number of terms remaining in the symmetrized hypersurface polynomial

46

• Sym CY Poly: A list of the terms, without coefficients, of the symmetrized hypersurface polynomial
• h11+, h11-: The split Hodge numbers of the orientifold
• OPlanes: A list of the orientifold planes found by the scan. Each orientifold plane
will have two fields:
– ODim: The dimension of the orientifold plane (3, 5, or 7)
– OIdeal: The (reduced) list of polynomials whose vanishing define the orientifold
plane
• Naive String Vacua: Whether the orientifold Calabi-Yau admits the naive Type
IIB string vacua criteria

B.2

Example Entry

As an example, we display this information for the example from Section 3.1.
• Polytope #: 566
• Geometry #: 1
• Triangulation #: 1
• Involution #: 1
• h11: 4
• h21: 64

• Geometry-wise Invol: true
• Volume Parity: -1
• # Sym CY Terms: 48
• Sym CY Poly: In this case, all of the terms are symmetric, so this is the same as CY Poly. We
avoid repeating it for brevity.
