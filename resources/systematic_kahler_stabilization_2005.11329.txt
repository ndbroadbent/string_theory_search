Abstract: Achieving full moduli stabilisation in type IIB string compactifications for
generic Calabi-Yau threefolds with hundreds of Kähler moduli is notoriously hard. This is
due not just to the very fast increase of the computational complexity with the number
of moduli, but also to the fact that the scalar potential depends in general on the supergravity variables only implicitly. In fact, the supergravity chiral coordinates are 4-cycle
volume moduli but the Kähler potential is an explicit function of the 2-cycle moduli and
inverting between these two variables is in general impossible. In this paper we propose a
general method to fix all type IIB Kähler moduli in a systematic way by working directly
in terms of 2-cycle moduli: on one side we present a ‘master formula’ for the scalar potential which can depend on an arbitrary number of Kähler moduli, while on the other we
perform a computer-based search for critical points, introducing a hybrid Genetic/Clustering/Amoeba algorithm and other computational techniques. This allows us to reproduce
several known minima, but also to discover new examples of both KKLT and LVS models,
together with novel classes of LVS minima without diagonal del Pezzo divisors and hybrid
vacua which share some features with KKLT and other with LVS solutions.

Introduction

Stabilising the moduli fields that determine the size and shape of the extra dimensions
has been one of the most important challenges for string compactifications for decades.
Flux compactifications of type IIB string theory are probably the most explored since 3form fluxes stabilise the complex structure moduli U α (counted via α = 1, · · · , h1,2 ) and
the dilaton S, producing a huge landscape of solutions. Conversely the Kähler moduli
Ti (counted by i = 1, · · · , h1,1 ) can be fixed only after perturbative and non-perturbative
corrections to the Kähler potential and superpotential are included. This last stage of the
stabilisation is under less control, due to the difficulty of computing quantum corrections,
and of writing the scalar potential explicitly in terms of the correct 4D supergravity chiral
coordinates.
This issue becomes evident when we recall that the imaginary parts of the Ti fields
include the 4-cycle volume moduli τi which also give the gauge couplings of the gauge
theories living on D7-branes wrapped around internal 4-cycles. Thus the T -moduli appear
directly in the non-perturbative superpotential. On the other hand the tree-level Kähler
potential depends directly on the overall Einstein-frame volume:
V=

1
kijk ti tj tk ,

(1.1)

where kijk are the triple intersection numbers of the underlying Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold
and ti are 2-cycle volumes. The 4-cycle moduli τi are determined in terms of their dual ti
as:
∂V
1
τi = i = kijk tj tk .
(1.2)
∂t
2
In order to write the full effective action in terms of the T -fields, (1.2) needs to be inverted
to express ti as a function of τj which can only be done for simple cases. However a
generic CY compactification features a large number of Kähler moduli, typically of order
h1,1 = 100 − 1000 (see for instance [1–3] for classifications on complete intersection CY
manifolds and [4, 5] for CY manifolds as hypersurfaces in toric ambient varieties).1
As well as the computational complexity of finding the minimum of a potential with
several variables, the fact that in general the scalar potential depends only implicitly on
the 4-cycle moduli creates a hard technical obstacle to finding explicit vacua for CY compactifications with large h1,1 . For this reason the vast majority of work in the literature has
so far focused only on simple examples such as the original KKLT model [10] for h1,1 = 1,
and vanilla LVS vacua for Swiss cheese and K3-fibred compactifications with h1,1 = 2, 3
and diagonal del Pezzo (dP) divisors, where (1.2) can be inverted exactly [11–13].
In this paper we propose a new approach to type IIB Kähler moduli stabilisation
which allows one to overcome these technical issues. Our key idea is to work directly in
terms of the 2-cycle volume moduli which appear explicitly in the scalar potential. In
combination with a computer-based search this can in principle discover the critical points
1
See also [6, 7] for partial classifications. Furthermore, it has recently been found that CY manifolds
with a comparably large number of moduli have interesting and distinctive properties [8, 9].

for an arbitrary number of Kähler moduli. Indeed we shall present a ‘master formula’ for the
scalar potential generated by α0 corrections to the Kähler potential and non-perturbative
contributions to the superpotential which is valid for arbitrary numbers of 2-cycle moduli.
Our subsequent numerical analysis then exploits both Lipschitz optimisation and a hybrid
Genetic/Clustering/Amoeba algorithm.
For convenience, we will illustrate the efficiency of our general method by focusing on
CY examples that still have a relatively small number of moduli, but our analysis should
be considered as a first step towards tackling more general cases with much larger h1,1 .
In fact, even though in this paper we focus on h1,1 ≤ 3, our method is already able to
reveal the existence of entirely new classes of vacua. More precisely, we first show how
our ‘master formula’ for the scalar potential in terms of 2-cycle volume moduli combined
with our numerical techniques can reproduce several known models, such as standard AdS
KKLT vacua [10], dS KKLT solutions with α0 uplift [14–17] and both AdS and dS LVS
minima [11–13]. But we then go on to show that our method can also find new examples
of both KKLT and LVS models and, more interestingly, it can uncover entirely new classes
of LVS minima without diagonal dP divisors, and hybrid vacua that share features of both
the KKLT and the LVS solutions.
The developments that we make towards establishing a new systematic approach to
Kähler moduli stabilisation can be summarised as follows:
1. We present a ‘master formula’ for the scalar potential as a function of the 2-cycle
moduli for an arbitrary number of Kähler moduli. The scalar potential is generated
by generic single-instanton non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential and
the leading O(α03 ) correction to the Kähler potential [18]. In this first-step approach
to Kähler moduli stabilisation we neglect string loop corrections [13, 19, 20] and
F 4 O(α03 ) contributions [21] which depend explicitly on 2-cycle moduli, providing
further motivation for the idea of working directly in terms of the t-fields. Given that
these corrections are suppressed with respect to the leading O(α03 ) contribution by
either direct powers of gs  1 or inverse powers of the internal volume V  1, it is
consistent to neglect them, although we will include them in future work which will
provide a more comprehensive analysis. For this work we should note that string
loops have been used to fix the moduli in [22–27] for simple K3-fibred LVS models
with 1 or 2 diagonal dPs, while ref. [28] showed that F 4 O(α03 ) effects can fix all the
Kähler moduli of any CY with arbitrary large h1,1 and at least a single dP divisor.
In addition the stabilisation of an arbitrarily large number of Kähler moduli in [28]
has been achieved by minimising analytically with respect to 2-cycle moduli.
2. We consider the large database of CY threefolds constructed by Kreuzer and Skarke
as hypersurfaces in toric ambient varieties [5], and we identify the models with h1,1 =
1, 2, 3 that can be treated with KKLT and LVS techniques (recall LVS needs at least
two 4-cycles, a ‘big’ and a ‘small’ divisor). In addition, we find the percentage of
models where the relation between 2- and 4-cycle volume moduli cannot be inverted
explicitly, so identifying those models that cannot be studied by standard stabilisation
techniques, where our new method is particularly powerful.

–3–

3. We introduce new powerful computational tools for locating and identifying local
minima, for example a hybrid Genetic+Clustering+Nelder-Mead algorithm. This
technique is of general applicability in systems with many local minima. Due to the
computational complexity of identifying local minima we will in practice combine of
such numerical approaches with analytical techniques.
4. We recover from our ‘master formula’ all the main scenarios that have been proposed
so far, for both AdS and dS vacua, including KKLT, α0 -uplift and LVS, by specifying
just 3 quantities: the CY Euler number, the Hodge number h1,1 and the number of
non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential.
5. We focus on CY threefolds whose volume does not admit a simple expression in
terms of 4-cycle volume moduli, and we find new concrete examples of KKLT vacua
for h1,1 = 2 and LVS minima for CY compactifications with h1,1 = 3 and just a
single diagonal dP divisor. Moreover we find the first examples in the literature
of LVS models for CY compactifications with 3 Kähler moduli none of which is a
diagonal dP 4-cycle. We also discover novel vacua for CY threefolds with h1,1 = 2
and no diagonal dP 4-cycle. We call these entirely new solutions ‘hybrid’, because
the value of the volume at the minimum scales as in KKLT models but the effects
used to stabilise the moduli are the same as in LVS models.
This paper is organised as follows. In the Sec. 2, after collecting all conventions, we
provide the general expression for the scalar potential of the Kähler moduli parametrised
by the 2-cycle moduli, and we then discuss the conditions that have to be satisfied to make
the effective field theory trustable. In Sec. 3 we make a systematic study of all the models
in the Kreuzer-Skarke list with Hodge numbers h1,1 = 1, 2, 3, classifying those that have a
structure admitting LVS vacua and those whose volume form cannot be written explicitly
in terms of 4-cycle moduli. In Sec. 4 we then show the power of our general method by
first reproducing known AdS and dS vacua, and then discovering novel classes of stabilised
vacua. Our conclusions are finally presented in Sec. 5. We have also collected several
technical details in the appendices, starting with App. A which shows how the scalar
potential of several known models can be easily read off from our ‘master formula’. The
details of the codes used to search for global and also local minima are then explained in
Apps. B and C, the first describing the Lipschitz optimisation algorithm and the second
a hybrid of a genetic algorithm and Clustering and Nelder-Mead algorithms. All of these
methods (with their various strong and weak points) are used in combination with analytic
calculations to properly identify the local minima. Finally we have included tables of CY
models with h1,1 = 2, 3 in Apps. D and E.

Type IIB effective theory

2.1

Type IIB preliminaries

The F -term contributions to the N = 1 scalar potential governing the dynamics of low energy effective supergravity are computed from the Kähler potential K and the holomorphic

where the covariant derivatives are defined with respect to all the chiral variables on which
K and W generically depend.
2.1.1

Fixing the conventions

The massless states in the 4D effective theory are in one-to-one correspondence with harmonic forms which are either even or odd under the action of an isometric, holomorphic involution σ acting on the internal CY threefold, and these generate the equivariant cohomolp,q
ogy groups H±
(X). Let us fix our conventions and denote the bases of even/odd 2-forms

O5/O9-planes, one has K = 0, ..., h+ and Λ = 1, ..., h− .
The various fields can be expanded in appropriate bases of the equivariant cohomologies. For example, the Kähler form J, the 2-forms B2 , C2 and the RR 4-form C4 can be
expanded as [35]:

J = ti µi ,

B2 = ba νa ,

C2 = ca νa ,

C4 = ρi µ̃i + D2i ∧ µi + V K ∧ aK + UK ∧ bK ,

(2.3)

where, as mentioned before, ti denotes 2-cycle volume moduli, while ba , ca and ρi are
various axions. Furthermore (V K , UK ) forms a dual pair of space-time 1-forms and D2i
is a space-time 2-form dual to the scalar field ρi . Also, since σ ∗ reflects the holomorphic
α
3-form Ω3 , we have h2,1
− (X) complex structure moduli U appearing as complex scalars.
Moreover, the involutively-odd holomorphic 3-form Ω3 generically depends on the complex
structure moduli and can be written in terms of the period vectors as:
Ω3 ≡ X Λ AΛ − FΛ B Λ ,
where F = (X 0 )2 f (U α ) is a generic pre-potential, with U α =

some function dependent on the complex structure moduli [36]. Apart from the complex
structure moduli, the dynamics of the N = 1 type IIB 4D effective theory can be described
using the following additional chiral variables (S, Ga , Ti ) defined as in [37]:

At the perturbative level, the Kähler potential receives two kinds of corrections: α0

2 (2π)3
and gs corrections have been estimated throughout the years, turning out to be either
subdominant or reabsorbable by field redefinitions. Finding all the possible α0 corrections
is an open question. For a recent discussion of these corrections see for instance [38].
The block diagonal nature of the total Kähler metric (and its inverse) admits the
following splitting of contributions:
e−K V = KAB (DA W ) (DB W ) − 3|W |2 ≡ Vcs + Vk ,

(2.9)

where:
αβ

Vcs = Kcs

and

Vk = K AB (DA W ) (DB W ) − 3|W |2 .

(2.10)

Recall that the indices (α, β) correspond to the complex structure moduli U α while the
indices (A, B) run over the remaining chiral variables {S, Ga , Ti }. For our purposes, we
choose the orientifold involution such that the odd (1, 1)-cohomology sector is trivial, and
so there will be no odd moduli present in the current analysis.

A master formula for the scalar potential

For a generic superpotential which depends on all closed string chiral variables, namely S,
Ti and U α , the F -term scalar potential (2.1) can be rewritten as:
αβ
(Dα W ) (Dβ W ) + K SS (DS W ) (DS W ) + K ST i KT i (DS W ) W
e−K V = Kcs

+ KTi K Ti S (DS W ) W + K ST i (DS W ) W T i + K Ti S WTi (DS W )
+ KTi K Ti T j W W T j + WTi K Ti T j KT j W + WTi K Ti T j W T j


+ KTi K Ti T j KT j − 3 |W |2 .

(2.19)

In standard flux compactifications with F3 and H3 fluxes, the tree-level superpotential
depends only on the complex structure moduli and the axio-dilaton, i.e. W = W0 (U α , S).
This flux-dependent superpotential can fix all complex structure moduli and the axiodilaton supersymmetrically at leading order by enforcing:
Dα W0 = 0 = Dα W 0 ,

DS W0 = 0 = DS W 0 .

and

(2.20)

The Kähler moduli can appear in W only via non-perturbative effects. In what follows,
we shall assume n non-perturbative contributions to W which can be generated by either
rigid divisors, such as shrinkable dP 4-cycles, or non-rigid divisors with non-zero magnetic
fluxes [40–42]. The corresponding non-perturbative superpotential is then:2
W = W0 +

The exponents (−i ai Ti ) in (2.21) follow from the definition of the chiral variables in (2.5) which have
been chosen to make explicit the T-duality transformations between type IIA and type IIB [43].

–8–

Note that in (2.21) there is no sum in the exponents (−i ai Ti ), and summations are to be
understood only when upper indices are contracted with lower indices; otherwise we will
write an explicit sum as in (2.21). We will suppose that out of h1,1 Kähler moduli, only
the first n appear in W , i.e. i = 1, ..., n ≤ h1,1 .
Assuming that the S and U -moduli are stabilised as in (2.20) and considering a superpotential given by (2.21), the scalar potential (2.19) reduces to:

Moreover, using the identities in eqs. (2.16)-(2.17) which include O(α03 ) corrections to the
Kähler potential, this scalar potential can be written as the sum of three terms:
V = VO(α03 ) + Vnp1 + Vnp2 ,

Notice that VO(α03 ) reproduces the known O(α03 ) contribution to the potential first derived
in [18]. This term vanishes for ξˆ = 0, reproducing the standard no-scale structure in the
absence of a T -dependent non-perturbative W . On the other hand, for very large volume

Let us also stress that VO(α03 ) depends only on the overall volume V, while Vnp1 depends
on V and the 4-cycle moduli τi (with the additional dependence on the axions ρi ). Hence
these two contributions to V could be minimised by taking derivatives with respect to
V and (h1,1 − 1) 4-cycle moduli. However Vnp2 depends on the quantity kijk tk which in
general cannot be inverted to be expressed as an explicit function of the τi ’s. Thus our

master formula for the scalar potential shows that moduli stabilisation is more naturally
performed in terms of the 2-cycle moduli ti . As discussed in the introduction, we will see
that this strategy allows the study of a much wider set of cases, leading to new interesting
moduli stabilisation schemes.
Moreover (2.23) determines the complete form of V simply by specifying topological
quantities such as the intersection numbers and the CY Euler number which controls O(α03 )
corrections, and the number n of non-perturbative contributions to W . Before proceeding
to find new vacua, in Tab. 1 we show how our master formula can elegantly reproduce
known moduli stabilisation models parametrised by different choices of h1,1 , n and ξˆ (see
App. A for an explicit derivation of these potentials from our master formula).

Table 1: Various classes of known models whose scalar potential can be easily read-off from our
master formula (2.23).

Furthermore, our master formula features an explicit dependence on all phases and
axion fields. In this paper we shall fix the axions analytically and scan numerically for
minima along the directions of the 2-cycle moduli. However (2.23) allows for a more
general numerical analysis of the many axion potential. We leave this for future work.
2.3

Validity of the effective field theory

Before using the master formula in (2.23) to find new minima, let us list the conditions
that have to be satisfied to trust the validity of the low-energy 4D effective field theory:
(i)

1. Stringy corrections: Stringy effects can be neglected if each 2-cycle 
Σ2 , i =
(i)

1, ..., h1,1 , has a string-frame volume larger than the string scale, i.e. Vols Σ2
α0

1, ..., h1,1 .



∀i = 
Given
 that
 string and Einstein frame volumes are related as
(i)
1/2
(i)
Vols Σ2
= gs VolE Σ2 , and expressing the 2-cycle volumes in units of `s =


√
(i)
2π α0 as VolE Σ2 = |ti | `2s , the condition to trust the supergravity regime is [26]:
|ti | 

1
1/2
gs (2π)2

∀ i = 1, ..., h1,1 .

(2.25)

The 10D tree-level action receives higher derivative corrections at different orders in
α0 which, at the level of the 4D effective theory, appear as an expansion in inverse
powers of the Kähler moduli. Hence the condition (2.25) guarantees that the α0

– 10 –

expansion is well-behaved. In what follows, we shall consider only the leading O(α03 )
correction to the Kähler potential in (2.8) which generates VO(α03 ) in (2.23). However
this expression can be trusted only if higher α0 effects can be neglected which requires:
ξ
3/2
2 gs V

 1.

(2.26)

2. String loops: A crucial requirement to trust moduli stabilisation is that perturbation theory does not break down. Given that string loop corrections to the Kähler
potential are proportional to the string coupling gs , we need therefore to impose:

S−S
−1
−φ
gs = e =
 1,
(2.27)
2i
which can be met by an appropriate choice of background fluxes that fix S. In our
analysis we shall neglect gs corrections to the effective action. As explained in [13, 50],
this is justified by the existence of an ‘extended no-scale structure’ so that string loop
effects start contributing to the effective action only at O(gs2 α04 ).
3. Non-perturbative effects: The superpotential (2.21) contains only single-instanton
contributions while in general multi-instanton effects would also be present. These
can be safely neglected if:
ai τi  1

∀ i = 1, ..., n .

(2.28)

4. 4D supergravity regime: The low-energy supergravity theory admits a valid 4D
description only if the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are heavy. In a string compactifica(i)
tion, there can actually be several KK scales MKK associated with either bulk modes
or open string excitations on D7-branes wrapped around 4-cycles. We therefore require the following hierarchy of mass scales:
(i)

m3/2 , mmod  MKK . Ms  Mp

∀i,

(2.29)

where mmod denotes generic moduli masses, m3/2 is the gravitino mass, Ms is the
string scale and Mp is the reduced Planck mass given by (see [27] for the proper
normalisation factor κ = gs eKcs /(8π) in 4D Einstein frame):

(i)

The condition Ms  Mp ∀ i is guaranteed by (2.25) while MKK . Ms corresponds
to τi & gs−1 which is always true for ‘large’ 4-cycles while it is marginally satisfied for
(i)
relatively ‘small’ moduli. The condition m3/2  MKK is more severe when i = bulk

– 11 –

with τbulk ≃ V 2/3 . In this case we have therefore to impose:
r
κ
(bulk)
|W0 |  V 1/3 ,
m3/2  MKK
⇔
π

(2.31)

which sets an important upper bound on the vacuum expectation value of the fluxgenerated superpotential |W0 |.
5. Superspace higher-derivative expansion: Ref. [51] established that the coupling
(bulk)
of heavy bulk KK modes to light states scales as g ∼ MKK /Mp ∼ V −2/3  1.
Denoting the auxiliary field of the light fields as F ∼ m3/2 Mp and the UV cut-off
(bulk)

as Λ ∼ MKK , the superspace derivative expansion is therefore under control if
(bulk)
g F/Λ2 ∼ m3/2 /MKK  1, which is guaranteed to hold if (2.31) is satisfied.

Explicit CY examples

In this section we will present a classification of all CY threefolds with 1 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 3 from
the Kreuzer-Skarke list where these manifolds have been constructed via toric geometry
[5]. We will perform this analysis with the help of a database [7] which provides several
topological properties of all CY threefolds with 1 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 6 arising from triangulations
of the polytopes of the Kreuzer-Skarke list. The most relevant data that we will use are
the GLSM charges, the Stanley-Reisner (SR), the intersection tensor, the Mori cone and
Euler characteristics. Knowing the GLSM charges along with the SR ideal will enable us to
analyse the divisor topologies using the cohomCalg package [52, 53]. We will then perform
a choice of divisor basis which takes the overall volume V in its simplest possible form
and makes some important features for moduli stabilisation manifest (like the presence of
diagonal dP divisors for LVS constructions). This will also allow us to divide the models
into those where the volume admits a simple form in terms of 4-cycle volume moduli, and
those where it does not.
This classification will then be used in Sec. 4.1 and 4.2 to show how our master formula
can be used to stabilise the Kähler moduli in generic situations where the volume can be
expressed in a simple way only as a function of 2-cycle moduli. In fact, we will show that
converting 2- into 4-cycle volume moduli can be hard even for simple examples where only
a few intersection numbers are non-zero. In what follows we denote the various models as
Mi,j , where i indicates the value of h1,1 while j labels a given CY threefold at fixed h1,1 .
3.1

h1,1 = 1

In the presence of a single Kähler modulus the conversion from t to τ is trivially possible.
In this case the Kreuzer-Skarke database features 5 distinct CY threefolds whose details
relevant for moduli stabilisation are summarised in Tab. 2.

3.2

h1,1 = 2

In the Kreuzer-Skarke database there are 36 reflexive polytopes with h1,1 = 2 leading
to 48 triangulations [7]. However given that different polytopes can lead to the same
triangulations, there are only 39 distinct CY geometries listed in Tab. 11 in App. D. As
can be seen from Tab. 11, in all cases 1 intersection number can always be eliminated
by an appropriate choice of basis.3 All these 39 models with h1,1 = 2 can be classified as
follows:
• 22 CY geometries feature 1 diagonal dP 4-cycle, allowing them to be written in the
3/2
3/2
strong Swiss cheese form V ∼ τ1 − τ2 . The negative sign arises from the Kähler
cone condition t1 < 0 which characterises all LVS models, as can be seen in Tab. 11.
• 10 CY threefolds are K3-fibred. In these cases at least 2 intersection numbers can be
removed by an appropriate choice of basis. For example, if D1 is the K3 divisor, one
can always find another suitable divisor D2 to form a basis where k111 = k112 = 0, as
a consequence of a theorem for K3-fibred CY threefolds [54, 55]. Moreover, in some
cases (like CP4 [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), it is even possible to make k222 = 0, leaving k122 as the
√
only non-zero intersection number and V ∼ t1 t22 ∼ τ1 τ2 . As can be seen from Tab.
11, M2,33 is an example with this simple form of the CY volume.
• 7 CY threefolds do not admit a simple volume form in terms of 4-cycle volume moduli.
These are the examples which are of interest to us and are highlighted as ‘hard’ in
Tab. 11. The simplest example in this class of models is M2,1 with volume form:
V=


1 2
t1 t2 + t1 t22 .

(3.1)

This simple example already illustrates the difficulty to invert the relations between
2- and 4-cycle volume moduli which look like:
τ1 = t1 t2 +

1 2
t ,
2 2

τ2 = t1 t2 +

1 2
t .
2 1

(3.2)

Here we limit the discussion to the coordinate divisors but there may be some non-toric divisor combinations that reduce this number further. However, such cases are likely to be non-smooth and hence they
are not suitable for phenomenology.

The conversion from 2- to 4-cycle moduli results in the following 4 sets of solutions:

t2 = ±

where:

r
x± =

τ2 − 2 τ1 ± 2

q

(3.4)

A unique solution is identified by the Kähler cone conditions {t1 > 0, t2 > 0} which
select in (3.3) the x+ -dependent solution with positive signs. In order to illustrate our
numerical analysis, in what follows we shall consider M2,6 and M2,20 as representative
benchmark examples of this class of ‘hard’ CY models.
3.3

h1,1 = 3

In the h1,1 = 3 case, a generic CY geometry features 10 intersection numbers. In the
Kreuzer-Skarke database, there are 244 reflexive polytopes for h1,1 = 3 leading to 569 triangulations [7]. However given that different polytopes can lead to the same triangulation,
there are only 305 distinct CY geometries which we classify as follows:4
• 232 CY geometries have at least 1 divisor, say Dp , whose corresponding intersection
numbers satisfy the following condition first derived in [56]:
kppi kppj = kppp kpij

∀ i, j .

(3.5)

This condition allows to trade easily one 2-cycle modulus for τp since it guarantees
that τp can be written as a perfect square of a sum of 2-cycle volume moduli if
p
kppp 6= 0 (or trivially if kpij = 2 kpii kpjj with i 6= j for kppp = 0) since:
2
1
1
τp = kpij ti tj =
kppi ti .
2
2kppp

(3.6)

Out of these 232 cases, 132 are standard LVS models where Dp is a dP divisor with
kppp 6= 0, while in the remaining 100 cases Dp has a different topology, and so the
relation (3.6) is not guaranteed to hold. In turn, in these 100 cases the volume form
does not necessarily admit a simple expression in terms of 2-cycle volume moduli.
Following [56], the 132 LVS geometries can be classified as:
1. Strong Swiss cheese: 39 models have a volume given schematically by V ∼
3/2
3/2
3/2
τ3 − τ2 − τ1 , which is equivalent to saying that for such models one can
always find a basis where the only non-zero intersections are k111 , k222 and k333 .
2. K3 fibrations: 43 models are K3-fibred, leading to a volume form which can be
√
3/2
written schematically as V ∼ τ3 τ2 − τ1 , implying that the only non-zero
intersection numbers as k111 and k233 .
4

The number of distinct CY examples is actually 306 but 1 is a non-favorable geometry which we do
not consider relevant for phenomenology.

– 14 –

3. Strong Swiss cheese-like: 36 models feature a volume which schematically looks
3/2
like V ∼ τ3 − (a τ1 + b τ2 )3/2 − τ1 3/2 where a and b are positive integers.
This geometry is similar but qualitatively different from a strong Swiss cheese
since (a D1 + b D2 ) does not correspond to a smooth divisor, and so (a τ1 + b τ2 )
cannot be redefined as a new τx . These geometries have been used in [57] to
study poly-instanton effects and in [58–63] for cosmological applications.
4. Structureless: 14 models, despite admitting a diagonal dP, do not feature a
volume which can be written in terms of the τ ’s in a simple way. In these cases
3/2
the volume can be generically expressed as V ∼ f3/2 (τ2 , τ3 ) − τ1 where f is a
homogeneous function of degree 3/2. The relevant data for these 14 examples
are presented in Tab. 12 in App. E. In what follows we shall focus on model
M3,1 to illustrate our numerical analysis.
• 73 models do not admit a divisor like Dp which obeys the condition (3.5), implying
that in these cases the volume does not admit a simple form in terms of 4-cycle
volumes. These cases are definitely of interest for our numerical study, and so in
what follows we shall consider a representative example for this class of CY models,
which we call M3,15 , characterised by the following topological data:
M3,15 :

χ = − 240 ,

k111 = 4 ,

Kähler cone:

k112 = −2 ,

t1 > 0 ,

t2 > t1 ,

k113 = −2 ,
t3 > t1 .

k123 = 2 ,
(3.7)

Let us finally point out that this discussion shows that 118 models out of 132 LVS models
can definitely be studied using the conventional approach based on 4-cycle moduli, corresponding to 38.7% of all 305 cases. However the 14 ‘structureless’ LVS models and the 73
models without a divisor which satisfies (3.5) are certainly better analysed using 2-cycle
moduli, corresponding to 28.5% of all 305 cases.

Moduli stabilisation results

4.1

Reproducing old vacua

As a warmup to check the validity of our numerical analysis, we first focus on standard
KKLT vacua with a single Kähler modulus and typical LVS models with 2 Kähler moduli
one of which is a diagonal dP divisor.
4.1.1

KKLT with a single modulus

The potential of the simplest KKLT model with a single Kähler modulus and no α0 corrections is given by our master formula (2.23) which for h1,1 = n = 1 and ξˆ = 0
reduces to (setting hsi = gs−1 ):

After performing the axion minimisation by setting (a1 ρ1 +θ0 −φ1 ) = π, a simple calculation
leads to the following relation in a generic extremum for the saxion τ1 :

which excludes dS vacua in the minimal KKLT model. This problem can be circumvented
by adding uplifting contributions which can come from several different sources. In the
case of anti-branes, the uplifting term can be simply written as:
up
VKKLT

with

Vup =

where δ > 0 is a tunable flux dependent parameter. The new term Vup modifies the

the potentials (4.1) and (4.3), where we have set p = 3, can be minimised numerically for
all 5 CY threefolds with h1,1 = 1, leading to the results given in Tab. 3. One can easily
check that all minima lie in a region where the effective field theory is under control since
each condition of Sec. 2.3 is satisfied.

In the KKLT framework, dS vacua can also be achieved by including α0 corrections

This scalar potential can be minimised numerically with respect to either t1 or τ1 , since
in this simple case the conversion between 2- and 4-cycle moduli is trivial. The results of
our numerical analysis are presented in Tab. 4 which shows that these dS vacua tend to
be located at relatively small volume. However the effective field theory is still marginally
under control since all conditions listed in Sec. 2.3 are satisfied. In particular, the condition
(bulk)
(2.31) is still slightly met even for relatively small values of V since m3/2 ≃ 0.1 MKK .
For a condensing gauge group with rank N = 32, (corresponding to a1 = π/16), τ1 at the
dS minimum is around 15 as can be seen from Fig. 1. Larger values of hVi of O(50 − 100)
can be realised for N ∼ O(100) and |W0 | ∼ O(50 − 100) [14–16, 42] even if these values
have their own limitations and criticism [51, 64].

and ξˆ 6= 0. Taking the large volume limit and minimising the axionic direction ρ1 , this
scalar potential can be approximated as the sum of 3 terms:
VLVS = V1 + V2 + V3 ,
with:

where the model-dependent parameters α and β are positive while the sign of γ ∝ −χ
depends on the sign of the CY Euler number χ. Notice that the minus sign in front of
V2 is due to the ρ1 minimisation for β > 0. The 3 terms in (4.6) are of the same order if
V ∼ ea1 τ1 , and so any extremum of this potential lies at exponentially large volume.
Let us now analyse the vacuum structure of the LVS potential (4.6). Trading τ2 for the
overall volume V, the extremisation conditions ∂V VLVS = ∂τ1 VLVS = 0 lead to the following
relations among the 3 terms of the LVS potential at any extremum:

In the regime where the instanton series is under control, i.e. for a1 hτ1 i  1, the second
expression in (4.8) simplifies to hV2 i = −hV3 i < 0 which implies that a solution can exist
only if hV3 i > 0, i.e. for negative CY Euler number since γ ∝ −χ. In turn, (4.9) forces the
potential to be negative at any extremum, i.e. hVLVS i < 0. This is a no-go result for any
dS extremum, both potential minima and maxima. This is consistent with the known fact
that LVS models without any uplifting term give rise just to AdS minima.
This no-go result can be evaded by adding an additional positive contribution to the
LVS potential (4.6) which can be expressed as V4 = δ/V p with δ > 0. This term can come
from either anti-D3s [10], non-perturbative effects at singularities [65] or T-branes [66], and
modifies the relation (4.9) for the value of the potential V = VLVS + V4 at any extremum
as follows:

+ hV4 i 1 − −

(4.10)
2 a1 hτ1 i
3 6a1 hτ1 i
For p = 3, V4 can be reabsorbed into V3 via a proper shift of γ to include δ, and so hV i
is still negative. More generally, one can see that hV i < 0 for p ≥ 3. Hence, the only way
to evade the dS no-go result found above is to consider p < 3. In this case, (4.10) shows
clearly that one can easily obtain hV i > 0 since the term proportional to hV4 i becomes
positive (for a1 hτ1 i  1) and can compensate the fact that the term proportional to hV3 i
is negative. This is natural since in order to obtain dS minima the uplifting term has to
dominate at large volume.

Discovering new vacua

Let us now show how new classes of type IIB vacua can be found with the help of numerical
techniques and minimising the scalar potential with respect to 2-cycle volume moduli.
4.2.1

New KKLT vacua

Let us now focus on a case with h1,1 = 2, which leads to new KKLT vacua. This is model
M2,6 in Tab. 11 in App. D which we classify as ‘hard’ since V does not admit a simple
form in terms of the 4-cycle volume moduli. In this case we shall perform numerical moduli
stabilisation using the 2-cycle volume moduli.
The CY threefold of model M2,6 corresponds to the polytope ID #10 in the CY
database of [7] and it is defined by the following toric data:

The Hodge numbers are (h2,1 , h1,1 ) = (83, 2), the Euler number is χ = −162 and the SR
ideal is SR = {x1 x2 x3 , x4 x5 x6 }. As can be seen from Tab. 11 in App. D, the intersection
numbers and the Kähler cone in the basis of smooth divisors D1 = {1, 0} = SD1 and
D2 = {0, 1} = SD2 are:
k111 = k222 = 0 ,

k112 = k122 = 3 ,

Kähler cone:

t1 > 0 , t2 > 0 .

(4.12)

In this case the overall volume and the 4-cycle moduli take the following form:
V=

The scalar potential of this non-standard KKLT model can be obtained from our master
formula (2.23) by setting h1,1 = n = 2 and ξˆ = 12.4128 which follows from χ = −162 and
our choice of the string coupling gs = 0.1.
Notice that, under the exchange t1 ↔ t2 , both V and the Kähler cone are invariant
and τ1 ↔ τ2 . Thus the scalar potential is symmetric if A1 = A2 and a1 = a2 . In this case,
the minimisation solutions have therefore to be symmetric. In Tab. 5 we present such
symmetric solutions, along with non-symmetric ones for A1 6= A2 and/or a1 6= a2 . We

solutions. All minima lie in a region where the effective 4D theory is under control.

Larger values of the CY volume can be realised by increasing the rank of the condensing

New LVS vacua with a diagonal and a non-diagonal del Pezzo

We now focus on a new LVS model with h1,1 = 3 which we classified as ‘structureless’ since
V does not admit a simple form in terms of 4-cycle moduli. This is model M3,1 in Tab. 12
in App. E. In this case we will stabilise the moduli numerically using the 2-cycle moduli.
The CY threefold of model M3,1 corresponds to the polytope ID #61 in the CY
database of [7] and it is defined by the following toric data:

ideal is:
SR = {x1 x5 , x5 x6 , x1 x2 x7 , x3 x4 x6 , x2 x3 x4 x7 } .
The analysis of the divisor topologies shows that they can be represented by the following

As can be seen from Tab. 12, the intersection numbers and the Kähler cone in the basis of
smooth divisors D1 = {0, 1, 0} = dP8 , D2 = {0, 1, 1} = dP1 and D3 = {1, 1, 0} = SD2 are:

(4.13)

which shows clearly that D1 is a diagonal dP8 while D2 is a non-diagonal dP1 . In addition,
the overall volume and the 4-cycle volume moduli are as follows:

This shows clearly that V does not admit a simple expression in terms of 4-cycle moduli.
The potential of this structureless LVS model can be obtained from our master formula
(2.23) by setting h1,1 = 3, n = 2 and ξˆ 6= 0. In Tab. 6 we present the results of our numerical minimisation with respect to 2-cycle moduli for different choices of the microscopic
parameters, while Fig. 3 shows the minima for each of the 3 t-moduli for a particular
example (E6 in Tab. 6). All minima are within the regime of validity of the effective
theory.

Table 6: Benchmark examples for model M3,1 where we have set Kcs = A1 = A2 = 1, W0 = −1,
a1 = π, a2 = π/2 and A3 = 0.

As can be seen from Tab. 6, smaller values of the string coupling give rise to larger
values of V which improve the control over the effective field theory. This is expected since
it resembles the behaviour of standard LVS where the small 2-cycle t1 and the volume V
2
−1/2
would scale respectively as ht1 i ∝ gs
and hVi ∝ eht1 i .
A qualitative understanding of the results of our numerical minimisation can be gained
as follows. First note that, given that dP8 is a diagonal divisor, O(α03 ) corrections to K
and a single non-perturbative effect in W with A1 6= 0, would be sufficient to fix the volume
−1/2
exponentially large and ht1 i ∼ gs
together with the axion ρ1 . This would however leave
3 flat directions which can be parametrised for example by t2 , ρ2 and ρ3 . Because of the
axionic shift symmetry, the 2 flat directions ρ2 and ρ3 can be lifted only by T2 - and T3 dependent non-perturbative corrections to W which would generate a potential also for t2 .
However t2 can develop a potential also via perturbative corrections to K which would in
general dominate over non-perturbative effects if τ2 and τ3 (the 2 combinations appearing
in the exponent of the non-perturbative superpotential) were both large cycles.

Examples where the remaining saxionic flat direction is fixed by higher order α0 corrections are given in [28]. However our master formula (2.23) does not include this kind
of effect, and so we looked for minima where the remaining saxionic flat direction is fixed
at small values, so that the dominant source of its potential is non-perturbative physics.
This is possible for A2 6= 0 and A3 = 0 if the moduli are stabilised close to the Kähler cone
condition t3 > 2t2 in (4.13), but still far enough from it to be able to trust the effective

– 22 –

field theory. In fact, for t3 → 2t2 , the expressions (4.14) show that τ2 → 0 and τ3 → 27 t22 ,
and so a superpotential contribution of the form A2 e−a2 T2 would not be suppressed, while
A3 e−a3 T3 would be negligible for t2 stabilisation even if it would be crucial to fix ρ3 . Tab.
7 shows that the minima displayed in Tab. 6 are still fully within the regime of validity of
the effective field theory since each 4-cycle modulus, in particular τ2 , turns out to be fixed
at values much larger than unity.

Table 7: Values of the 4-cycle moduli for the benchmark examples of model M3,1 listed in Tab. 6.

In the general case where also A3 6= 0 the scalar potential should feature two minima:
(i) an LVS-like AdS vacuum with the same properties described just above but with a
massive, even if ultra-light, ρ3 axion; and (ii) an α0 -uplifted KKLT-like dS minimum where
however the CY volume would take values smaller than the one shown in Tab. 6 which
would affect the trustability of the effective field theory.
Let us finally point out that our numerical analysis has shown how model M3,1 can
lead to an LVS-like vacuum where not only the diagonal dP8 modulus τ1 , but also the
non-diagonal dP1 modulus τ2 , can be fixed at ‘small’ size. This observation raises the
question of whether it is possible to find new LVS vacua for CY threefolds which do not
admit diagonal divisors. This issue is addressed in the next section.
4.2.3

New LVS vacua without a diagonal del Pezzo

In this section we discuss a 3-moduli CY model that does not feature any diagonal dP
divisor. We shall show that despite this an LVS-like AdS minimum at exponentially large
volume still exists thanks to a particular symmetry of the Kähler moduli space. We shall
perform a detailed analysis of Kähler moduli stabilisation both via numerical techniques
and analytical approximations in terms of 2-cycle volume moduli focusing on model M3,15
introduced in Sec. 3.3. The CY threefold of model M3,15 corresponds to the polytope ID
#263 in the CY database of [7] and it is defined by the following toric data:

As can be seen from (3.7), the intersection polynomial in the basis of smooth divisors
D1 = {0, 0, 1} = dP5 , D2 = {0, 1, 0} = K3 and D3 = {1, 0, 0} = K3 is given by:
I3 = 4 D13 − 2 D12 D2 − 2 D12 D3 + 2 D1 D2 D3 .

(4.15)

The linearity of I3 in D2 and D3 , together with the divisor analysis, shows that this CY
threefold is K3-fibred. Moreover the fact that k112 , k113 and k123 are all non-zero implies
that D1 is a non-diagonal dP5 divisor. The CY volume and the 4-cycle moduli become:
2 3
t − t21 (t2 + t3 ) + 2 t1 t2 t3 ,

τ1 = 2 (t1 − t2 ) (t1 − t3 ) ,
τ2 = t1 (2 t3 − t1 ) ,

τ3 = t1 (2 t2 − t1 ) .

(4.16)

The potential of this model can be obtained from (2.23) by setting h1,1 = 3, n = 1 and
ξˆ > 0. In Tab. 8 we present the results of our numerical minimisation with respect to
2-cycle moduli for different choices of the microscopic parameters, while Fig. 4 shows the
minima for each of the 3 t-moduli for example E6 in Tab. 8. The large values of hVi show
that this model features an LVS-like AdS vacuum even though it does not have a diagonal
dP divisor. All minima lie in a region where the effective field theory is fully under control.

The emergence of this novel LVS vacuum can be qualitatively understood as follows.
The T1 -dependent non-perturbative W , in combination with O(α03 ) effects, stabilises τ1 at

– 24 –

‘small’ size and the CY volume exponentially large. The remaining flat direction in the
2-cycle volume moduli space, which we will parametrise as t∗ , is also lifted since the nondiagonality of D1 introduces a dependence of V on t∗ . Notice that the axions ρ2 and ρ3 can
become massive only after including T2 - and T3 -dependent non-perturbative contributions
to W . These terms would however be negligible for the stabilisation of the 2-cycle volume
moduli since all our minima are located at τ2 = τ3  τ1 , as can be seen from Tab. 9.

It is important to stress here that in general the non-diagonality of a dP divisor modifies the scaling behaviour with the overall volume of the different contributions to V , so
destroying the existence of an LVS minimum. However in our model this is not the case
due to the presence of a symmetry of the moduli space under the exchange t2 ↔ t3 , as can
be seen from (3.7) and (4.16).

The potential (4.17) therefore depends on only 3 variables: V, τ1 and t∗ . The dependence
on t∗ is very simple, signaling that there is a minimum at t∗ = 0, which implies t2 = t3 and
τ2 = τ3 from (4.16). Notice that this minimum lies well inside the Kähler cone since t∗ = 0
does not correspond to any boundary of the moduli space. More interestingly, for t∗ = 0,

These relations correctly reproduce the scaling behaviour of the numerical solutions presented in Tabs. 8 and 9. Let us stress that this is the first example of a CY threefold which
admits LVS vacua even without the presence of a diagonal dP divisor, implying that LVS
vacua in the string landscape occur more frequently than previously thought.
4.2.4

New hybrid vacua

In this section we shall study if numerical moduli stabilisation in terms of 2-cycle moduli
can reveal the existence of new LVS vacua in ‘hard’ h1,1 = 2 models where V does not
admit a simple form in terms of 4-cycle moduli. We will find that the absence of a diagonal
dP divisor combined with the simplicity of this model which has only 2 Kähler moduli
prevents the existence of an LVS-like vacuum. We will discover instead new vacua which
we term ‘hybrid’ since they share some features with standard LVS vacua and others with
typical KKLT models. We shall illustrate our claim by focusing on model M2,20 in Tab.
11 in App. D. The CY threefold of model M2,20 corresponds to the polytope ID #23 in
the CY database of [7] and it is defined by the following toric data:

The Hodge numbers are (h2,1 , h1,1 ) = (95, 2), the Euler number is χ = −186 and the SR

As can be seen from Tab. 11, the intersection numbers and the Kähler cone in the basis
of smooth divisors D1 = {0, 1} = dP1 and D2 = {2, 1} = SD2 are:

k112 = −2 ,

k122 = 0 ,

k222 = 14 ,

(4.22)

The potential can be obtained from our master formula (2.23) by setting h1,1 = 2, n = 1
and ξˆ 6= 0. In Tab. 10 we present the results of our numerical minimisation with respect
to 2-cycle moduli for different choices of the microscopic parameters, while Fig. 5 shows
a contour plot of the potential for 2 particular examples (E1 and E5). Notice that the
effective field theory is still under control even if |ht1 i| ∼ O(1) since all examples in Tab.
10 satisfy the condition (2.25) which guarantees that stringy corrections can be neglected.

Table 10: Benchmark examples for model M2,20 where we have set Kcs = 1, A1 = 10 and A2 = 0.

We stress that we considered only a T1 -dependent non-perturbative W since A2 = 0,
and so the Kähler moduli are fixed by balancing the leading α0 -correction to K against the
superpotential generated by gaugino condensation in a hidden gauge group with rank N .
This is the same stabilisation mechanism used in LVS models which are characterised by
an exponentially large volume hVi ∼ e1/(gs N ) that increases when either gs or N decreases.
However, as can be seen from Tab. 10 where we limit ourselves to N ≤ 16, in our new
vacua hVi increases when gs decreases but it reduces when N goes to lower values. Hence
these new vacua are not really LVS-like. This difference can be traced back to the absence
of a diagonal dP divisor together with the fact that this model has only 2 Kähler moduli
while the CY threefold discussed in Sec. 4.2.3 had h1,1 = 3.

The behaviour of these new vacua can be understood analytically as follows. Tab. 10
shows that, in all examples, the 2-cycle volume moduli t1 and t2 are fixed at |t1 | ≃ 1 and
t22  t21 . In this limit of the Kähler cone, the expressions for V and τ2 in (4.22) simplify to

are located at V  ξˆ and a1 τ1  1, and so our master formula (2.23) can be very well
approximated by (after ρ1 minimisation):

Notice that, similarly to LVS models, the negative sign in (4.24) is crucial to find a minimum. However the potential (4.23) does not give rise to a minimum at exponentially

The behaviour of this potential at large volume is qualitatively different from standard
LVS models where, after integrating out τ1 , one has:
VLVS ≃

−λ1 (ln V)3/2 + λ2
V3

with

λ1,2 > 0 .

(4.28)

For V  1, the LVS potential (4.28) is dominated by the logarithmic term proportional
to λ1 , and so it goes to zero from negative values, while for V ∼ O(1) it is dominated by
the term proportional to λ2 , and so it is positive. Clearly the potential has to admit an
AdS minimum at large volume. On the other hand, the potential (4.27) is not guaranteed
to feature a minimum since the term proportional to c3 dominates the potential for both
V ∼ O(1) and V  1, implying that at large volume it goes to zero from positive values. In
fact there is a window at intermediate volume values, i.e. for O(1) . V . O(100), where
the 2 terms in (4.27) can compete. This reveals the existence of a minimum, which is
however in a strong string coupling regime where the effective field theory is out of control,
and only a maximum at exponentially large volume. However, given that the axion ρ1 has
been kept fixed at its minimum, this would-be maximum is actually a saddle point.
The presence of a saddle point at exponentially large volume can be explicitly seen by
taking the first and second derivatives of (4.27) with respect to V which read as follows

For x  1, the second derivative is clearly negative, signaling the existence of a saddle

for x . 6.3. In order to trust the initial approximation f (τ1 , V) ≃ −2 73 V

Minima with 5.3 . x < 6 would be AdS, x = 6 would give Minkowski and 6 < x . 6.3
would yield dS. However one can check that none of these vacua can be trusted since they
would lie at gs > 1, in a regime where perturbation theory would break down. This can be
easily seen by using the minimisation equation in (4.29) as an expression for c3 with the
volume fixed in the regime 5.3 . x . 6.3, and then using this result to find the value of gs
3/2
knowing that c3 can be also expressed as c3 = 3ξ W02 /(4gs ).
This discussion implies that there is no minimum in the region of moduli space where

the two terms in (4.24) are always of the same order of magnitude since 0.5 . R . 1 for

which reproduces the behaviour of the volume in Tab. 10, since hVi increases when either gs
decreases or N increases. Moreover (4.34) implies that the combination r ≡ hVi(gs /R)3/2
should be more or less constant, and this is confirmed by all examples in Tab. 10 which
feature r ≃ O(40). This analytical estimate is useful also to perform our numerical study
since it provides reasonable initial conditions to easily find convergent solutions.
It is for these reasons that we term these new vacua ‘hybrid’: they clearly have some
similarities and also some differences with known stabilisation mechanisms which can be
summarised as follows:
• KKLT: both cases admit an AdS vacuum where hVi ∝ N 3/2 even if, contrary to
KKLT, in our new vacua supersymmetry is broken, α0 effects play a crucial rôle and
|W0 | does not need to be tuned exponentially small;
• LVS: both cases feature a non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum where non-perturbative
effects compete with α0 corrections for natural values of |W0 | even if, contrary to
LVS, in our new vacua the volume in string units is not exponentially large;
• α0 uplift: both cases have a minimum which breaks supersymmetry via balancing
non-perturbative against α0 contributions without tuning |W0 | even if, contrary to α0
uplift, our new vacua are AdS and require non-perturbative effects just for 1 modulus.

Conclusions

In this article we have presented a new systematic approach to type IIB moduli stabilisation
which is based on fixing the Kähler moduli through the 2-cycle volume moduli as opposed
to the standard approach which uses the 4-cycle volume moduli.

– 30 –

With the help of numerical techniques, we have been able to reproduce all known
approaches to type IIB Kähler moduli stabilisation and to identify new classes of models
that could not be determined with previous methods. In particular we discovered the first
examples in the literature of LVS vacua for CY threefolds which do not admit a diagonal dP
divisor. This implies that the presence of LVS vacua in the string landscape is more generic
than previously thought. An interesting future line of investigation would be to perform a
more systematic analysis of the frequency of LVS in type IIB flux compactifications.
Moreover our innovative approach to Kähler moduli stabilisation allowed us also to
reveal a new class of hybrid models where the volume is stabilised at values large enough
to be of phenomenological and cosmological interest, as well as to guarantee control over
the effective field theory approximation, but not exponentially large as in standard LVS
models. More work in this direction is certainly needed, both to explore the physical
implications of this new class of models and also to obtain better computational control
over the effective field theory.
In order to consider concrete models, we have been systematic in our approach and
started by covering all known models constructed from hypersurfaces in toric varieties by
Kreuzer and Skarke with Hodge numbers h1,1 = 1, 2, 3. We have classified them according
to whether they are of the LVS type: standard Swiss cheese LVS models, K3 fibrations
with a diagonal dP divisor, strong Swiss cheese-like examples and structureless LVS CY
models which can still lead to stabilised vacua with exponentially large internal volume.
The underlying message for analysing the dataset with 1 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 3 is that, while
all examples with h1,1 = 1 can be studied via the conventional approach based on 4-cycle
moduli, only 72% of the models with h1,1 = 2 and 50% of the models with h1,1 = 3 can be
analysed with this standard approach. Thus the new strategy described in our paper to
find stable vacua by working in terms of 2-cycle volume moduli is essential for achieving full
moduli stabilisation with supersymmetry breaking for h1,1 = 3, and indeed our approach
seems to be the only way to proceed for larger h1,1 .
This article can then be considered as only the first step towards the more systematic
aim of performing full moduli stabilisation with an arbitrarily large number of Kähler
moduli. With the analytic and numerical techniques developed in this article, we hope in
the future to approach concrete models with h1,1 ≥ 4, possibly even in the regime of large
h1,1 ∼ O(102 − 103 ) where we may be able to use a large Hodge number approximation.
Interesting directions for future work are the inclusion in our master formula of string
loop corrections and higher order α0 effects, as well as a detailed exploration of the axion
landscape for cases with large h1,1 . The presence of many axions allows for a potentially
large landscape inside the actual string landscape, with the added value that extrema
should be computable within the effective field theory as proposed in [67–69]. We hope to
come back and address these questions in the future.

3-moduli fibred LVS

We now focus on 3-moduli fibred LVS models whose potential can be derived from our
master formula (2.23) by setting h1,1 = 3, n = 2 and ξˆ > 0. Hence its form is the same as
P
in (A.9) but now 3k=1 kijk tk is different since the underlying CY threefold has a distinct
topological structure. In fact, in this case the CY features a K3 or T 4 -fibration over a P1
base together with a diagonal dP divisor (for explicit CY threefolds with this topology see
[24–26, 70]). Via an appropriate choice of basis, the only non-zero intersection numbers
can be chosen to be k111 and k233 , signaling that D1 is a diagonal dP divisor, D2 is a K3
or T 4 fibre and D3 contains the P1 base of the fibration. Thus we obtain:

By substituting these expression in (A.9) we can easily read off the potential of fibred LVS
models with 3 Kähler moduli. Interestingly, in [22] it has been shown that this potential
cannot give rise to any LVS vacuum in a regime where the effective field theory is under
control. In order to achieve this goal, one has to consider additional perturbative α0 or gs
corrections to the potential which are however not captured by our master formula (2.23).

Lipschitz optimisation algorithm

Exploring string theory models and related mathematical data vis-a-vis observations calls
for new approaches to moduli stabilisation. Central to the stabilisation exercise is the
need to minimise supergravity potential, a function of moduli fields that arises upon string
compactification. The classical approach were via the selection of CY base geometry by
hand and analytical minimisation of the one- or few-moduli potentials. In order to go
beyond this, numerical automisation is required for selecting geometries and finding the
positions of corresponding minima positions in moduli space. Here we describe a global
optimisation algorithm, Lipschitz optimisation (LIPO), used for numerically stabilising the
moduli fields of the example geometries addressed in this paper 5 .
5

There are many optimisation algorithms in the literature. The application of these for CY selections
and for finding corresponding minima in moduli space is an interesting research direction to pursue further.

Figure 6: From [72]. (a) A simple Lipschitz function f (x) evaluated over a sample of 4 points
(dots). (b) The upper limit function, U (x) is sketch in grey. (c) Here the domain of f (x) is reduced
to regions containing the maximum.

Lipschitz optimisation falls within the class of deterministic global optimisations (see
for instance [71]). The task is to find the absolutely best set of parameters for achieving a
mathematically-formulated objective. In [72] the LIPO algorithm for finding x ∈ Rd which
globally maximises a function f (x) was introduced. The DLIB library (see dlib.net)
implements LIPO algorithm and improves it with local trust tests at the global maximum
point. The basic principle for the Lipschitz optimisation is as follows.
A piecewise linear upper bound, U (x), of f (x) is used to decide which x to evaluate
at each of the optimisation steps. Given already evaluated points x1 , x2 , . . . , xj , U (x) can
be represented by:
U (x) = max (f (xi ) + k |x − xi |) ,
(B.1)
i=1...j

where k is the Lipschitz constant for f (x). By the definition of the Lipschitz constant, this
will give U (x) ≥ f (x) for all x. The algorithm selects a test point, xt randomly, and then
check if U (xt ) is better than the best of the points so far chosen. If true, then xt is selected
as the next point at which f (x) should be evaluated. For illustration, Fig. 6 (a) shows a
4-point sample for a simple function f (x). The grey lines in plot (b) show the upper bound
function U (x) constructed from the 4 sample points in (a). Plot (c) shows the region of
f (x) which satisfies the decision rule for selecting xt at which to evaluate f (x) next. It can
be seen that the procedure evolves such that over subsequent steps the selected points will
eventually reach the global maximum of the f (x).
In practice the Lipschitz constant is not known, the functions to be minimised (known
or unknown) can be very noisy, discontinuous or stochastic. LIPO could also be slow in
converging to the maximum though it finds the local region near the maximum quickly.
The implementation in DLIB is modified to tackle these problems.

C

A hybrid GA/Clustering/Amoeba algorithm to find all minima in a
potential

Finding all the stable or metastable minima in a system is a common problem in physics,
but heuristic search techniques tend to focus on the more iconic problem of correctly
finding the global minimum. While individual algorithms may be well suited to this one
task, collecting the locations of all the local minima as well as the global one in a given
search space may be more efficiently done by combining them, as indeed suggested by the

to local clusters but further convergence takes place slowly. The population in this case is 100
individuals.

analysis in the previous appendix. In this appendix we describe an algorithm that is a
combination of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) [73–76], followed by a Cluster Algorithm (CA),
followed by a Nelder-Mead (or amoeba) algorithm (NM) [77–79].
GAs seek optimal solutions by evolving a population of models in the search-space
which, by means of a suitable definition of ‘fitness’, is transformed into a fitness landscape.
Such algorithms are able to avoid stagnation and attempt to find the global minima in
NP-hard problems, and there has been some interest in their use in various contexts in
particle physics, for example in [80–94]. However it is known that once a GA begins to
select the favoured minimum the final stage of convergence is relatively slow. On the other
hand optimisation methods such as the Nelder-Mead algorithm flow to local minima and
cannot address NP-hard problems, but in the basin of attraction of a minimum the NM
method can converge much more quickly than a GA, if the function does not have many
discontinuities and the dimensionality of the search-space is not too large. This suggests
that a combination of these techniques may be beneficial. As we will see, for the problem
at hand there are other benefits.
In order to illustrate our procedure, we will consider finding the local minima for the
test function:
V (x, y) = −(36 sin(2y) cos(2x) + 12(x + y) − x2 − y 2 ) .

(C.1)

This function can be seen plotted in the background of Fig. 7. The evolution of a standard
GA with 100 individuals is also plotted in the figure. Although many popular GAs are
available, for our purposes it is more convenient to use our own tailored code. In particular in order to treat very flat potentials we use a simple roulette wheel selection genetic
algorithm with fitness based on ranking (so the GA works for potentials with directions
that are arbitrarily flat). As can be seen, within only a few generations the genetic algorithm clusters around the local minima. Continued convergence to the global minimum

– 37 –

Figure 8: Instead we run the GA several times for a few generations. Then a kmeans algorithm
determines a set of clusters. A representative d + 1 = 3 dimensional simplex is chosen from
each cluster, and a Nelder-Mead optimisation determines the local minimum (corresponding to the
maximum fitness in the figure) for each simplex.

then proceeds slowly. It can be enhanced by dialing down the mutation rate (due to the
relevant theorem of Holland) but then one risks losing all the information about the local
minima. One approach to the problem of identifying all the local minima is to dial down
the mutation ‘too early’, so that sub-populations gets trapped in them. However it is much
faster to pass to a NM algorithm as soon as clusters have formed.
We therefore treat the problem in 3 stages. First we perform the genetic algorithm
itself but with a relatively large (optimal) mutation rate. For the function we show here, a
population of around 100 was found to be optimal. The process is terminated at an early
stage after only a few generations, resulting in clusters located around the local minima as
we observed in Fig. 7. Note that if we wait too long, some of these clusters will begin to
disappear unless we also impose some kind of crowding penalty. An additional interesting
point is that (in contrast with a straight genetic algorithm) the overall process is better
with larger populations as the clusters that are initially established are better defined.
We then formally identify the clusters using a kmeans clustering algorithm. From each
cluster we then select the best d + 1 points (for a d dimensional function) in order to form
a representative d + 1 dimensional simplex. Finally we determine the local minimum for
each simplex using an NM (or amoeba) algorithm. Overall the process is very fast for our
example, and yields the outcome shown in Fig. 8. We include pseudo-code for the procedure
in Algorithm 1, and actual code is available at www.maths.dur.ac.uk/~dma0saa/GANM/.

Algorithm 1: Pseudo-code for combined GA+Cluster+Amoeba algorithm
There are several other advantages since for cases of relatively low dimension and without
discontinuities, the NM algorithm is known to converge rapidly and (like the GA itself)
does not need a differentiable function [78, 79]. However the problem in this paper becomes
6D and some local minima appear close to the Kähler cone where there is a discontinuity.
Thus the NM algorithm is somewhat less efficient even if the method still functions well.
