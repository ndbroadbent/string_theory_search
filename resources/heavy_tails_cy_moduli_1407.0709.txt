We study the statistics of the metric on Kähler moduli space in compactifications of string
theory on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. We find striking hierarchies in the
eigenvalues of the metric and of the Riemann curvature contribution to the Hessian matrix:
both spectra display heavy tails. The curvature contribution to the Hessian is non-positive,
suggesting a reduced probability of metastability compared to cases in which the derivatives
of the Kähler potential are uncorrelated. To facilitate our analysis, we have developed a
novel triangulation algorithm that allows efficient study of hypersurfaces with h1,1 as large
as 25, which is difficult using algorithms internal to packages such as Sage. Our results serve
as input for statistical studies of the vacuum structure in flux compactifications, and of the
distribution of axion decay constants in string theory.

Introduction

The vacuum structure of compactifications of string theory to four dimensions is extremely
complex, and direct enumeration of all vacua appears impossible. Moreover, it is plausible that
the number of vacua of string theory that are consistent with all present observations vastly
exceeds the number of measurements of fundamental parameters that could be performed in
the future. In this situation it is impractical, and for many purposes misguided, to pursue
individual vacua of string theory as candidate models of the observed universe. A more fruitful
course is to determine the characteristic properties of classes of vacua, and make statistical
predictions [1].
An idealized enumerative approach to vacuum statistics would begin with discrete data,
including the compactification topology and a specification of quantized fluxes, and compute
the full four-dimensional low-energy effective action as a function of these integer inputs. One
could then study the statistics of physical observables of interest in the ensemble of effective
actions resulting from all possible choices of discrete data. However, despite extensive efforts
to understand the statistics of string vacua (for reviews with references, see [2–4]), the present
reality falls short of this ideal. In particular, quantum corrections to the effective action
are poorly understood, and many of the most incisive results concern the distribution of
supersymmetric Minkowski vacua of a subsector of the theory, in the classical approximation.
For example, the elegant result of [5] in type IIB flux vacua describes an index approximating
the distribution of configurations for which the classical F-flatness conditions for the complex
structure moduli hold. The Kähler moduli, which can parameterize important instabilities,
are not included.
A central idea advanced in [1, 5–7] is that a reasonable approximation to the true distribution of string vacua can be obtained by determining the statistics of vacua in an associated
ensemble of N = 1 supergravity theories that are random in an appropriate sense. The expectation is that the Wilson coefficients of operators in the associated ensemble, when viewed
as stochastic variables, will closely follow the distribution of the true Wilson coefficients that
would be obtained if one could produce and study a large ensemble of genuine string vacua.
Ideally, this expectation can be checked and refined by comparison to small ensembles of
string vacua in computable special cases.
To specify an appropriate ensemble of random supergravity theories, one must provide
an ensemble of superpotentials W , each of which is a holomorphic section of a nontrivial
holomorphic line bundle over the moduli space M parameterized by the scalar fields φa of
the theory, as well as a corresponding ensemble of Kähler potentials, which in local coordinates
are real analytic functions of the φa and their conjugates φ̄ā . In the simple special case of
supersymmetric Minkowski solutions, the vacua are determined by holomorphic equations of
the form
∂W
= 0,
(1.1)
∂φa
with no dependence on the Kähler potential. The task of computing the distribution of super-

–2–

symmetric Minkowski vacua therefore requires only the specification of statistical properties
of superpotentials, and some significant mathematical results are applicable to this problem:
there exists a precise notion of a random holomorphic section of a random holomorphic line
bundle in this context [8].
Unfortunately, knowledge of the superpotential alone is insufficient for studying supersymmetric vacua with nonvanishing cosmological constant, or non-supersymmetric vacua of
any type: one must also specify the Kähler potential. Rather little is known about what one
could reasonably call a random Kähler potential, or a random Kähler metric, especially for
dimC M > 1, which is the case of primary interest (though see [9] for recent progress). Because possible Kähler potentials are poorly characterized, it appears difficult to give a precise
definition of a random supergravity theory, and thereby to create a well-defined ensemble of
effective theories whose statistics could accurately model the statistics of non-supersymmetric
solutions of string theory.
In this work we begin to address this question, by exploring the characteristics of Kähler
metrics in a well-motivated ensemble of effective theories. Specifically, we study the Kähler
moduli spaces of compactifications of string theory on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties, considering in detail O3/O7 orientifolds of type IIB. A primary goal is to understand
the extent to which the resulting ensemble of Kähler metrics can be viewed as an ensemble
of random matrices without “special” properties. Said differently, our null hypothesis —
assumed implicitly or explicitly in earlier works such as [1, 5–7, 10] — is that the various
covariant derivatives of the Kähler potential at a fixed point in field space are tensors whose
components are statistically independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). For brevity, we
will say that the Kähler potential is an i.i.d. function.1 This is a rather strong assumption,
which few would argue describes the actual set of Kähler potentials arising in Calabi-Yau
compactifications, but it has been used in the past for want of a ready alternative. By exploring an ensemble of explicit Calabi-Yau compactifications gathered from the Kreuzer-Skarke
database [12] we will be able to reject the null hypothesis and expose some of the underlying
structure of the metrics on Calabi-Yau moduli spaces.2 This is a step toward specifying the
ensemble of possible non-holomorphic data along the lines that possible superpotentials were
characterized in [8].
More specifically, our null hypothesis is that the curvature contribution to the Hessian

We use the term “i.i.d. function” to avoid confusion with other notions of random functions, which can

context.

where Kb̄de
¯ and Kab̄cd̄ denote derivatives of the Kähler potential K, and Fa is the F-term.
We find compelling evidence against (1.3). For Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties,
the eigenvalue distributions of HR constructed from explicit Kähler potential data have much
longer tails than predicted by (1.3). The spectra we obtain are very leptokurtic, with a sharp
peak and heavy tails. We obtain a related result for the Kähler metrics themselves: the
eigenvalue spectra of the metrics on Kähler moduli spaces exhibit large hierarchies and heavy
tails, at least in the case of O3/O7 orientifolds that we study directly.
We then argue that for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties, the structure of the
Kähler metric on M leads to distinctive changes in a basic statistical observable, the probability of metastability, in comparison to the probability resulting from the null hypothesis for the
Kähler metric. Specifically, significant correlations originating in the geometry of the moduli
space ensure that the covariant derivatives of K are not all independent, and we argue that, in
the case of O3/O7 projections of type IIB, these correlations turn out to make the probability
of metastability lower in the actual effective theory than it is in an effective theory where
the Kähler potential is an i.i.d. function. As a result, even though our analysis establishes
that one of the working assumptions of [10], namely (1.3), must be modified substantially to
reflect actual Calabi-Yau compactifications, the qualitative conclusion of [10], which is that
instabilities are extremely prevalent at generic points in the moduli space, appears to be
strengthened by our findings, at least in this corner of the landscape.
The presence of lengthy tails in the distribution of eigenvalues of the metric also has
significant consequences for model-building with axions in string theory, because axion decay
constants fa are given by (the square roots of) eigenvalues of the Kähler metric. While
individual axion decay constants have been computed in special cases [15], trends in models
with multiple axions have not previously been characterized. Our finding that the largest
eigenvalues are hierarchically larger than the median eigenvalues implies qualitative changes
in scenarios for axion inflation in string theory.
This paper is organized as follows. In §2 we review the application of random matrix
theory to the supergravity Hessian, and then discuss how to include deterministic data on
Kähler metrics in this approach. In §3 we review the Kähler moduli space of O3/O7 orientifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds and prove an important negativity result for the curvature
Hessian HR (1.2). In §4 we describe our method for generating an ensemble of moduli space
metrics and curvature Hessians. In §5, we present our primary results, demonstrating the
existence of hierarchies and heavy tails in the spectra of the metric and HR . We also elucidate
the source of the heavy tails in HR and discuss potential implications for metastability. In §6
we discuss alternatives to the i.i.d. model for the curvature Hessian, including a qualitatively
successful approach in which the metric on moduli space is modeled as a Bergman metric.
In §7, we consider the consequences of the eigenvalue distribution of the Kähler metric for

–4–

the spectra of axion decay constants. Our conclusions appear in §8. Appendix A contains
an abbreviated review of toric varieties and their Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, which are the
focus of our study. Finally, in Appendix B we present an efficient algorithm to triangulate
the polytopes encoding the toric variety data.

Random Kähler Metrics and Random Supergravities

In this section, we review the Hessian matrix in four-dimensional supergravity (§2.1) and
recall how it can be modeled using the tools of random matrix theory, following [7, 10] (§2.2).
2.1

the Kähler transformations K → K + f + f¯, W → e−f W , where f is a holomorphic function of

Random supergravities

Creating a globally well-defined potential energy function depending on N fields is exponentially expensive at large N . However, to understand the behavior at a collection of critical
points, including the particularly interesting case of metastable minima, only certain local
data about the potential are necessary: it suffices to specify the first four derivatives of the
Kähler potential K, and the first three derivatives of the superpotential W , at each point
of interest. By performing Taylor expansions of the N = 1 data at a set of well-separated
points, one can construct an ensemble of Hessian matrices, and characterize the probability
of metastability (or of any other outcome of interest) in this ensemble. In this approach, no
information about correlations from point to point is retained. Understanding correlations
in field space is left as a problem for future work.3
The essential assumption made in random supergravity approaches to the Hessian (2.4)
is that the Kähler potential and the superpotential are real and holomorphic i.i.d. functions,
respectively, on the moduli space [7, 10]. That is, expressing the Kähler potential via a Taylor
series around a fixed origin,
K = K0 + Ka φa + Kā φ̄ā + Kab̄ φa φ̄b̄ + · · · ,

(2.7)

the elements of each tensor Kab···c̄d···
¯ are taken to be independent and identically distributed
variables: each element is drawn from some statistical distribution Ω, and although the same
distribution is used for every element, each element is drawn independently from the others
(up to the symmetries of the tensor). We use the notation x ∈ Ω (µ, σ) to denote that the
real number x is drawn from a distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ. When z
is complex, z ∈ Ω (µ, σ) means that z = x eiθ , where x is a real number drawn from Ω and the
phase θ is drawn from a uniform distribution. We will often work with normal distributions,
though universality in random matrix theory ensures that most results will be independent
of the details of the distribution Ω, for sufficiently large N .
At a particular critical point of the potential, we can perform a Kähler transformation
and coordinate redefinition to set
K = 0,

Kab̄ = δab̄ ,

Fa = δa1 F eiϑF ,

(2.8)

in which F is positive and ϑF is an unimportant phase. The random supergravity approach
is then to model the higher derivatives as i.i.d. variables,

in which msusy is a characteristic scale for supersymmetric mass terms. At generic critical
points, we expect that msusy ∼ F (in Planck units).
Two classical ensembles of matrices are particularly relevant for our analysis and for the
models of [7, 10]. The first is the complex Wigner ensemble [16], which consists of n × n
Hermitian matrices of the form
M = A + A† ,
(2.11)
in which each element of A is an i.i.d. complex variable. The other relevant ensemble is the
complex Wishart ensemble [17], consisting of n × n Hermitian matrices of the form
M = AA† ,

(2.12)

in which A is an n × q matrix (q ≥ n) with i.i.d. complex entries. The eigenvalue spectra for
these ensembles take on the characteristic shapes shown in Figure 1.
The structure of the Hessian (2.4) and the special structure of the Riemann tensor (2.6)
suggest that, under the i.i.d. assumptions (2.9) and (2.10), the various contributions to the

The requirement of being at a critical point necessarily spoils the i.i.d. assumption, as the potential is
subject to the 2N conditions ∂a V = 0 at that point. However, since these are O (N ) conditions on a matrix

with O N 2 entries, at large N imposing the critical point equation does not significantly affect positivity
properties [10].

where we are locally working in a basis such that (2.8) holds at the critical point under
consideration. In [10], it was established that the typical spectrum of eigenvalues of an
ensemble of i.i.d. supergravity Hessians is well-modeled by the sum
Hi.i.d. ≈ HWWW = Wigner + Wishart + Wishart .

(2.14)

The spectrum of the ensemble HWWW is shown in Figure 2a. In [10], it was found that the
p
probability for a generic critical point to be metastable scales as e−cN , where p ≈ 1.5 for
Hi.i.d. and p ≈ 1.9 for HWWW .
This random supergravity approach must be modified when one or more of the i.i.d. assumptions (2.9) and (2.10) is invalid. Some form of modification is clearly necessary to give
a detailed model of string compactifications, as the resulting supergravity data are expected
to exhibit significant correlations. Although a complete incorporation of all such correlations

–8–

is impossible given current knowledge, we can make considerable progress by incorporating
information about the classical Kähler potential.
In the following sections, we revisit the supergravity Hessian (2.4) using ensembles of
Kähler potentials for the classical metrics on Kähler moduli space in explicit Calabi-Yau
compactifications. Since our focus is on how correlations in the Kähler geometry impact the
Hessian, we retain an i.i.d. approach to the F-terms and focus on the Riemann contribution
to the Hessian, HR , which can be analyzed without further modeling of the superpotential
and its higher derivatives Zab and Uabc .

The Kähler Moduli Space of O3/O7 Orientifolds

In this section, we review the Kähler moduli space of compactifications of type IIB string
theory on O3/O7 orientifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds. These compactifications are wellexplored, and allow for a separation of scales between the masses of the stabilized complex
structure moduli and Kähler moduli as in [14, 18]. We will assume that such a separation
has been achieved and so limit our treatment to the Kähler moduli sector. In the following
sections, we will make use of the corresponding classical Kähler potential to improve upon
the i.i.d. treatments discussed in §2.
After reviewing some of the basic properties of the moduli space, we provide expressions
for the metric and Riemann curvature that will be useful for our scan of moduli spaces, and
then prove a simple but important negativity property of the curvature contribution to the
Hessian (2.4).
3.1

The Kähler cone

A compactification of type IIB string theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold yields an N = 2
theory in four dimensions.5 The deformations of the Kähler structure, together with scalars
provided by the p-form potentials C4 , C2 , and B2 , form a quaternionic Kähler moduli space
of real dimension 4h1,1 , where hp,q are the Hodge numbers of the Calabi-Yau. Reduction to
an N = 1 theory is accomplished by the introduction of orientifold planes, and the structure
of the resulting supergravity theory depends on which orientifold projection is used. We
will assume an O3/O7 orientifold action, and moreover will take all of the divisors D a of
the Calabi-Yau to be even under the geometric involution (i.e. h1,1
− = 0), so that all Kähler
deformations of the Calabi-Yau are projected in by the orientifold action. In the resulting
R
N = 1 theory, the 4-cycle volumes τ a are paired with R-R axions ca = Da C4 to form the
complex scalar components ρa = τ a + i ca of h1,1 chiral superfields. The classical Kähler
potential for the Kähler moduli space metric, at leading order in α′ , is given in terms of the
volume V of the Calabi-Yau by
K = −2 log V .
(3.1)
5

See, for example, [19–21] for reviews of the effective field theories arising in these constructions and in
their orientifolds.

–9–

If {D a } is a basis of divisors of the Calabi-Yau, then the Kähler form of the Calabi-Yau can
be expanded in terms of the Poincaré duals [D a ] of these divisors,
J = ta [D a ] .

in which κabc = D a · D b · D c are the triple intersection numbers of the divisors. The volume
of the divisor D a is then
1
∂V
(3.4)
= κabc tb tc .
τa =
∂ta
2
The Calabi-Yau volume V and the Kähler potential on moduli space are easily expressed
in terms of the variables ta , which parameterize the volumes of 2-cycles. However, the 2-cycle
volumes do not provide good Kähler coordinates in O3/O7 projections, in that we cannot
write the metric as ∂wa ∂¯w̄b̄ K where wa is a complexification of ta . Because the τ a , rather
than the ta , provide good coordinates on moduli space, we find it convenient to use lowered
indices for 2-cycle volumes, even though this goes against convention.
The Kähler moduli space is specified by the requirement that the volumes of all holomorphic curves and divisors, and of the Calabi-Yau itself, are positive. Since the volumes of such
R
objects are of the form J k , where J is the Kähler form (3.2), the moduli space is a cone: if
~t = (t1 , · · · , th1,1 ) is a point in the moduli space, then so is λ~t for λ > 0.
The space of curves also forms a cone, called the Mori cone, that is generated by a finite
set of curves Ci . The condition that all curves have positive volume is equivalent to the
condition
Z
J > 0 , ∀ Ci .
(3.5)
Ci

The condition (3.5) suffices to ensure positivity of the volumes of all divisors and of the CalabiYau, and so the Kähler cone is the set of ta that satisfy (3.5). Writing the intersections of
the divisors with the curves Ci as
Qai = D a · Ci ,
(3.6)
a sufficient condition to be in the interior of the Kähler cone is
Qai ta > 0 ,

∀i.

(3.7)

In general, there are more than h1,1 generators of the Mori cone, and so Q is not a square
matrix (though see the discussion in Appendix A). In this case the Kähler cone is said to be
non-simplicial, meaning that the number of generators of the cone is larger than the dimension
of the cone (see Figure 3). When Q is square, the Kähler cone is simplicial.

originating from the apex.

3.2

The metric and curvature on moduli space

The metric and curvature on moduli space follow from taking derivatives of the Kähler potential with respect to the Kähler coordinates ρa = τ a + i ca . However, since the classical
Kähler potential is independent of the axions ca , we can make the replacement

implicit function of the coordinates τ a . We therefore make extensive use of the chain rule

Since the coordinates τ a are defined via (3.4), Aab is difficult to calculate directly from its
definition (3.9), but can be calculated by inverting (3.10). In what follows, we will perform
the inversion numerically, as the analytic computation is expensive when h1,1 is large. Higher
derivatives of the Kähler potential will involve differentiating Aab , and numerical differentiation can be avoided by using (3.10):

The Riemann contribution to the Hessian

The Hessian (2.4) receives a contribution from the Riemann tensor on moduli space contracted
with F-terms (2.4b),

(3.15)
HR ab̄ := −eK Rab̄cd̄ F̄ c F d ,

This contribution in turn breaks into two pieces involving the third and fourth derivatives of
the Kähler metric (2.6),
(3.16)
HR = HK(3) + HK(4)

where

(HK(4) )ab̄ := −eK Kabcd F̄ c F d ,

(HK(3) )ab̄ := eK Kace Kb̄de

(3.17)

Although the presentation (3.12c) does not make the positivity of HK(3) manifest, it does
demonstrate that HK(3) and HK(4) have very similar structures. This similarity is a manifestation of the fact that the higher derivatives of the Kähler potential cannot be taken to
be entirely independent, a fact which will have important implications for the spectrum of
the Hessian. Indeed, both HK(4) and HK(3) will be seen to exhibit dramatic tails in their
eigenvalue distributions that are cancelled to some degree in the full curvature contribution
to the Hessian, HR = HK(3) + HK(4) . Even so, the residual tails in HR are substantial.

– 12 –

Despite the relative complexity of (3.14), the resulting contribution to the Hessian, HR ,
exhibits a striking property: when F 6= 0, HR always has at least one strictly negative
eigenvalue. The proof of this is quite simple, and relies on the fact that the Kähler metric is
a homogeneous function of the Kähler coordinates. Indeed, under ρa → λρa we have
Kab̄ → λ−2 Kab̄ .

(3.18)

In order to show that HR has a negative eigenvalue, it suffices to show that (HR )ab̄ ξ a ξ¯b̄ < 0

with equality only when F = 0, in which case HR is identically zero. It is easy to show
that this generalizes: if the metric is a homogeneous function of negative degree, then HR
will always have at least one negative eigenvalue. Moreover, this result holds for Kähler
moduli spaces in other string theories. However, quantum corrections to the Kähler potential
will necessarily spoil the homogeneity of the metric (indeed, the homogeneity of the Kähler
metric is closely related to no-scale structure) and so (3.24) is guaranteed to hold only at
weak coupling and large volume.
The negativity result (3.24) is quite different from the expectation of the random supergravity approach discussed in §2.2. In particular, the i.i.d. model for the curvature contribution to the Hessian is well-modeled by the sum of a Wishart matrix and a Wigner matrix, as
in (1.3) [10]. The resulting distribution of eigenvalues is shown in Figure 2b. Although the
vast majority of the members of an ensemble of such matrices will have at least one negative
p
eigenvalue, there is a small probability P ∼ e−cN that a randomly chosen matrix will be
positive-definite.
We now turn to constructing an ensemble of Kähler metrics on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces,
where we will find even more dramatic deviations from the model (1.3).

Method

Although the classical metric on the Kähler moduli space of a Calabi-Yau compactification
is given explicitly in terms of 2-cycle volumes and triple intersection numbers by (3.12a),
for h1,1 & 5 it is difficult to extract meaningful characteristics of the metric analytically.
Moreover, for the reasons explained in §1, it is most useful to determine general statistical
properties that hold for most or all members of an ensemble of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
Our approach is to construct an ensemble of classical Kähler metrics Kab̄ that describe
the Kähler moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Moreover, by combining this explicit metric data with i.i.d. F-terms, we construct an ensemble of curvature
contributions HR to the supergravity Hessian matrix. In this section, we provide a detailed
prescription for generating these ensembles. In short, we triangulate a number of reflexive
polytopes to obtain the topological data of desingularized Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric
varieties, making use of the Kreuzer-Skarke database [12] generated by PALP [22, 23], and
then sample the associated Kähler cones.
4.1

Generating metrics

The functional form of the classical Kähler potential K is fully specified by the intersection
numbers, which in the case of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a toric variety are determined by a
triangulation of the associated polytope (see appendix A for a brief review of toric geometry).
The computational cost of the triangulation process grows very quickly with the number of
Kähler moduli. In appendix B, we present an efficient triangulation algorithm that allows us
to study hypersurfaces with h1,1 . 25 using modest computational resources.
The relevant outputs of the triangulation algorithm, for a given Calabi-Yau, are the
intersection numbers among divisors, κabc , and between the divisors and generators of the
Mori cone, Qai . The Kähler cone is generated by a finite number ν of h1,1 -dimensional vectors
~nα , with α = 1, . . . , ν. That is, every point in the interior of the cone can be written in the
form
~t = sα~nα
(4.1)
for positive sα . In general, there may be more than h1,1 generators ~nα (i.e., ν > h1,1 ) in
which case the cone is non-simplicial (see Figure 3).
Given the intersection numbers κabc , the components of the Kähler metric, expressed
in a fixed coordinate system, are determined by the 2-cycle volumes ta , i.e. by the vacuum
expectation values of the Kähler moduli. Thus, to build an ensemble of Kähler metrics arising
at points in the moduli space of any one Calabi-Yau threefold, we must specify a collection
of points inside the Kähler cone. Next, to assemble the larger ensemble of metrics arising
at points in the moduli spaces of a collection of distinct threefolds, we must specify how we
choose a set of polytopes, a set of associated triangulations, and a collection of points in the
Kähler cone determined by each triangulation.

– 14 –

Schematically, the probability of some measurable outcome O (e.g., a given hierarchy in
the eigenvalues of the metric) may be written in the form
P (O) = P (polytope) × P (triangulation) × P (ti )

(4.2)

where P (ti ) denotes the measure chosen for sampling the Kähler cone. The first two factors in
(4.3) encode the relative weighting given to distinct choices of topological data. Lacking any
principle to determine this measure, we give equal weight to each distinct set of intersection
numbers obtained in our approach.
Next, one would aspire to choose a sampling measure P (ti ) that reflects broad characteristics of the actual distribution Pvacua (ti ) of string vacua inside the Kähler cone, which can
be written on general grounds as
Pvacua (ti ) = Pgeometric (ti ) × Pselection (ti ) ,

(4.3)

where the first factor denotes the geometric measure induced on the Kähler cone by the
Kähler metric on moduli space, and tends to be peaked near the boundaries of the cone.7
The second factor encodes additional selection effects: for example, one might expect that
string vacua are more common near the walls of the Kähler cone because the superpotential
for the Kähler moduli is exponentially small when all volumes are large. (Here we have in
mind the general lore that corrections are important where they are not computable [24].)
Characterizing Pselection requires a complete understanding of dynamics, which is inaccessible
at present. As a result, we must be agnostic about whether the sampling measure P (ti ) that
we choose provides a reasonable approximation to Pvacua (ti ).
The choice of P (ti ) can be encoded in the choice of coefficients sα appearing in (4.1).
Because the Kähler cone has infinite volume, it is necessary to impose a long-distance cutoff
on the sampled region. Since the metric and its derivatives are homogeneous functions of
the 2-cycle volumes, taking sα to be within a finite interval can provide a representative
sampling of the cone. A natural choice is to draw sα from a uniform distribution, and this is
the choice that we make for much of our analysis. However, with this prescription the ratios
of 2-cycle volumes remain within a comparatively small range, and potentially interesting
behavior near the walls of the Kähler cone, where the ratios of 2-cycle volumes are large, is
not fully explored. To address this deficiency we draw the sα from a logarithmic distribution
for a portion of our dataset.
4.2

Constructing curvature Hessians

The method presented in §4.1 suffices to generate an ensemble of Kähler metrics, but in order
to specify a scalar potential on field space we must also give a prescription for determining
W and its derivatives. As discussed previously, we are assuming a hierarchical separation of
7

The volume of moduli space as measured by the Kähler metric is divergent, even on a constant volume
slice, due to divergences of the metric near the boundaries of the Kähler cone.

– 15 –

scales between the Kähler moduli and other closed-string moduli, and therefore the effective
number of chiral multiplets is N = h1,1 .
The curvature contribution HR to the Hessian, (3.15), depends on the superpotential only
through the F a , while the remainder of the Hessian receives contributions from ∂a ∂b W and
∂a ∂b ∂c W as well. For this reason, we focus in this work on the properties of HR , which are
more directly geometric, and less affected by our limited knowledge of the superpotential, than
the properties of the full Hessian H. Developing an accurate model of the superpotential and
characterizing the resulting Hessian matrix, perhaps along the lines of [25], is an important
problem for the future.
To construct HR , we take the F-terms Fa of the Kähler moduli ρa , expressed in the toric
basis, to be i.i.d. variables (cf. (2.8)),

Results

Following all of the steps laid out in the previous sections, we can now present the eigenvalue
CY for a collection of 120
spectra of the Kähler metrics Kab̄ and the curvature Hessians HR
Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Although most of this section pertains to O3/O7
projections of type IIB, §5.6 contains a brief analysis of the curvature Hessians in other corners
of the string landscape.
5.1

Metric eigenvalue spectra

To study the spectrum of metric eigenvalues we fix the basis of Kähler moduli to a basis of
independent toric divisors, as discussed in Appendix A. We then compute the eigenvalues of
the moduli space metric in this basis, projected to the V = 1 hypersurface of the Kähler cone.
The metric scales homogeneously with the volume, so restricting to any other fixed value of
the volume will only change the overall scale of the metric eigenvalues. In Figures 4 and 5,
we present the eigenvalue spectra for an ensemble of moduli space metrics for a Calabi-Yau
threefold with h1,1 = 15. There are two notable features that appear in all of the examples we
examined: the spectra manifest large hierarchies, with the largest and smallest eigenvalues

are highly peaked.
The sharply-localized distributions of the smallest few eigenvalues can be attributed to
the particular dependence of V on the 4-cycle volumes. It is convenient to work in a basis

that diagonalizes the matrix Aab = −∂ 2 V/∂τ a ∂τ b . We refer to the diagonalized A-matrix
as Â. In Figure 6a we show the relationship between the largest 4-cycle volume τL and the
compactification volume V, where τL is measured in a basis where Aab = Âab . Because V
3/2
is approximately linear in τL , it appears that the single parameter τL controls the overall
volume of the Calabi-Yau in this region of moduli space. The smallest eigenvalue of the
metric, λg , is strongly correlated with V — see Figure 6b — and so the rescaling to V = 1
makes the distribution of λg highly localized. The smaller 4-cycles, on the other hand, do not
change the volume very much, and the corresponding metric eigenvalues have a larger spread.
As τL increases, changes to the other 4-cycle volumes result in a smaller relative change to
the overall volume, and so these tendencies become more pronounced.
The hierarchies in the metric eigenvalues are an intriguing and important feature that
we will discuss further in the following sections.

plot of the entire spectrum is shown in Figure 9.

substantially longer than the tail towards positivity. This may come as a surprise, given the

Although we have focused on a particular example, Y25 , the bulk of the spectra of HR
calculated on other Calabi-Yau manifolds are qualitatively very similar, especially for larger
h1,1 (see Figure 11). However, the tails of the distributions behave in quantitatively different
ways: as we demonstrate in §5.4, the greater the curvature of moduli space, the longer the

negativity and so for graphical purposes, and only within this section, we will reverse the sign
of ρR and shift the origin, so that the tail toward negativity in ρR is displayed extending to
the right and peaking at zero.

The distribution is heavy-tailed if and only if for all γ > 0, eγx S (x) diverges as x → ∞. A
canonical example of a heavy-tailed distribution is the Pareto distribution, for which the pdf
fβ;k (x) = β kβ x−β−1 has support for x > k. For a normal distribution, eγx S (x) → 0 for
any γ > 0, so the tails are not heavy. Exponential distributions fκ = κe−κx (κ > 0) are a
marginal case in which the limit vanishes, diverges, or converges to a finite value depending
on whether γ is less than, greater than, or equal to κ.
A sufficient condition for a distribution to be heavy-tailed is that the hazard function
h(x) := − log S(x) is strictly concave downward. In Figure 13a, we compare simulated hazard
functions for the Pareto, half-normal, and exponential distributions to that of the last 10% of
CY computed for Y . The hazard

curves for the half-normal and power law distributions are strictly concave up and down,
indicating light and heavy tails, respectively. The simulation of the hazard function for the
exponential distribution does not clearly possess either concavity, and indeed the analytic
result is h(x) = κ x.
The hazard function for ρR in Figure 13 appears to be very slightly concave downward.
A straightforward way to determine the concavity is to fit the hazard function to the form
ĥ = a + b x1+w . When w > 0, the model curve is concave upward, while when w < 0, the
model curve is concave downward. In Figure 13b, we show the χ2 calculated from the best fit
for a variety of values of w, indicating that the data are well-fitted by a curve that is concave
down: by this measure, w ≥ 0 is excluded with extremely high confidence. A rough estimate
of errors was obtained by subdividing the populations into five equal groups and combining

However, using a parametric test for concavity is potentially problematic, as a concaveupward curve may in principle give a better fit to the data. A non-parametric test for
concavity was described in [26]. Given a function y = f (x) and three points {x1 , x2 , x3 }, the
concavity C (x1 , x2 , x3 ) is equal to +1 (−1) if the quadratic interpolation between the three
points (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), and (x3 , y3 ) is concave up (down), and equals 0 if the points are
collinear. The method described in [26] yields an approximation to the expectation value of

hCi = −0.62±.06, giving strong evidence for downward concavity. Removing the points in the
beginning of the distribution (which constitute the bulk of the distribution rather than the
tail) or the end (which are statistically limited) tends to increase the significance of concavity.

data from an exponential distribution gives hCi = 0.02 ± 0.06, and so an absence of curvature

CY in the example of Y
In summary, the eigenvalue spectrum ρR of HR
25 has large positive
excess kurtosis (i.e., is leptokurtic), with much longer tails than those of a normal distribution.
Moreover, from the negative concavity of the hazard function we conclude that ρR is in
fact a heavy-tailed distribution, with a survival function that falls off more slowly than any
exponential.
While we will not present here the corresponding analyses for other examples of CalabiCY in all of
Yau threefolds, we find similarly pronounced tails in the eigenvalue spectra ρR of HR
the threefolds. Indeed, in an ensemble of threefolds with h1,1 = 10, . . . , 25 and five threefolds
at each h1,1 , we find that the average best fit value to ĥ = a + b x1+w is w = −0.52 ± 0.15.
We find comparable results for the metric eigenvalue spectrum as well: not only are the
tails of the metric distributions quite extensive (see Figure 5b), they are formally heavy.
5.4

Explaining the tails in the spectra

CY in Calabi-Yau
Having established the existence of heavy tails in the spectra ρR of HR
hypersurface examples, we turn to explaining the causes of these tails. From the form
¯
(HR )ab̄ = −Rab̄cd¯F̄ c F d , it is easy to see that the length of the tails in HR is intimately
related to the curvature of moduli space as measured by

R 2 := Rabcd Rabcd ,

(5.2)

¯

which, like the Ricci scalar R = −Kad Kb̄c Rab̄cd¯, is invariant under the homogeneous rescaling
~t → λ~t. Let us explore this connection in detail. At any given point in moduli space, we can
adopt Kähler normal coordinates in which Kab̄ = δab̄ , in which case the curvature contribution
to the Hessian becomes
¯

¯

(HR )ab̄ = −Rab̄cd̄ F̄ c F d = −Rab̄cd̄ δcē δf d Ff F̄ē .

(5.3)

For fixed F 2 , parametrically large eigenvalues occur when Fa points in directions of large
curvature. In Kähler normal coordinates, R 2 is just the sum of the squares of the entries in
the Riemann curvature tensor, and so the minimum eigenvalues satisfy
λR,min ≥ −R |F |2 .

(5.4)

The precise alignment of the F-terms with the Riemann tensor required to saturate the
bound (5.4) will not occur in generic cases: instead there will be a misalignment by a random
rotation. Therefore, generically the eigenvalues of HR will respect the approximate bound
λR & −R |F |2 /h1,1 .

(5.5)

One might think that an even stronger bound may result due to cancellations between
opposite-sign terms in the curvature tensor. However, we find empirically that in the deep
interior of the Kähler cone, the components Rab̄cd¯ of the Riemann tensor (in the toric basis

– 24 –

used throughout this work) are mostly positive.8 Indeed, if the components of the Riemann
tensor had no statistical preference for either sign then an ensemble of Ricci scalars taken from
a Calabi-Yau example would be clustered around zero. As shown in Figure 14, R is negative
and linearly correlated with R, which is a manifestation of the preference of the components
of Riemann Rab̄cd¯ to have a positive sign.9 To understand this finding, we compare to a few
simple reference cases. First, the Ricci scalar of a Riemann tensor that has i.i.d. components
with zero mean has no preference for either sign, and there is no significant correlation between
the invariants: see Figure 15a. In the special case of a Kähler manifold for which the metric
depends only on the real part of the coordinates, the Ricci scalar has a slight preference to
be negative, but there is little correlation between R and R (Figure 15b). Finally, in an
ensemble of Riemann tensors on a Kähler manifold with i.i.d. positive coefficients, the Ricci
scalar indeed turns out to be negative, but with only a very slight correlation (Figure 15c).
Clearly, the structure of the Riemann tensor on a Calabi-Yau Kähler moduli space is more
intricate than that of these reference models. The empirical results just described are related
to the conjectured bounds on the sectional curvature proposed in [27] (see also [28] for a
related proposal and [29] for counterexamples). However, not all examples that we examined
have a negative Ricci scalar.
Similar behavior occurs for other threefolds, though the characteristic sizes of the curvatures can be quite different for different threefolds, with no simple scaling with h1,1 . An
example Calabi-Yau with h1,1 = 20 exhibits smaller curvatures and correspondingly less negCY : see Figure 16.
ative eigenvalues of HR
The bound (5.5) is simply a scaling result, with the factor of h1,1 determined by modeling
a random rotation in a space of dimension h1,1 , and we can only expect it to hold up to an
O (1) multiplicative factor. Figure 17 compares the minimum eigenvalues of an ensemble of
CY , for a number of threefolds, to the curvature invariants R. We observe that
spectra of HR

76% of the data satisfy the bound (5.5), while 96% satisfy the weaker bound λCY

The scaling of the Hessian eigenvalues with curvature is modulated by the fact that
alignment of the F-terms with the directions of maximum curvature is non-generic. It is
then interesting to consider the effect that changing the direction of F̂a = Fa / |F | has on
the tail population. Finding the direction of F̂ that minimizes the smallest eigenvalue is
computationally challenging at even modest h1,1 , and so we consider an example with h1,1 = 4.
In a particular basis and at a fixed point in moduli space, the maximal sectional curvature
is R11̄11̄ ≈ 103, where we have rotated coordinates so that the direction of largest sectional

Note that this does not violate the antisymmetry of the Riemann tensor, which requires for example that

That the curvatures are large compared to unity might cause concern since the curvature of moduli space
often diverges near the boundaries of the Kähler cone, where cycles collapse and the supergravity approximation
is no longer trustable. However, the points that we consider here are in the bulk of the cone, where α′ corrections
are under control.

The maximum value of R sets an approximate bound for the minimum eigenvalue of HR
Although the curvature is well behaved, albeit often large, in the interior of the cone, the metric may degenerate and the curvature diverge near the boundary (typically near boundaries
that have codimension greater than 1). The boundaries of the Kähler cone are marked by
the collapse of one or more 2-cycles where corrections to the leading-order Kähler potential
become important, and so we have remained away from the boundaries in all of our analysis
thus far. However, to expose the relationships between curvature and eigenvalue hierarchies
derived from the leading-order Kähler potential, it is useful to approach the boundaries, with
the understanding that in actual string compactifications there would be large corrections to
these results.
We illustrate this in an example with h1,1 = 15, approaching a codimension two boundary
of the Kähler cone where Aab = ∂ta /∂τ b degenerates. The distance to the wall is parameterized by t, which measures the volume of the two 2-cycles that are shrinking. In Figure 19a
we demonstrate the relationship between R and t: the curvature diverges as we approach

that a Hessian drawn from the ensemble has only positive eigenvalues. In this section we will
comment briefly on the effect of heavy tails on P+ .
Direct study of P+ requires a fully-specified stochastic model for the superpotential and
its derivatives. While in a characterization of HR the details of the superpotential model have
little impact, in the full Hessian H they can be determinative. To apply the i.i.d. model of W
used in [7, 10], it is necessary to fix a physically meaningful ambiguity, namely the relative
r.m.s. sizes of Fa , Zab , and Uabc . As explained in this context in [10], the relative magnitudes of the F-terms and of the supersymmetric masses encoded in Zab reflect the strength of
supersymmetry breaking, and the prevalence of corresponding instabilities. Modeling supersymmetry breaking in this manner necessarily introduces a large degree of model-dependence,
and we defer a detailed analysis to future work.
Even without modeling the non-curvature Hessian H −HR , we can draw a few qualitative
conclusions about the impact of the heavy tails toward negativity in HR . We consider the
fraction of eigenvalues that are negative in our ensemble of curvature Hessians HR , and
compare this to the fraction of negative eigenvalues in the i.i.d. Wigner+Wishart model
discussed in §2.2, i.e. for the null hypothesis (1.3).
Focusing first on Y25 , the mean fraction of negative eigenvalues is 43%, which is significantly higher than the 14% fraction we find in Wigner+Wishart matrices of the same size.
However, the distribution in the case of Y25 has a wider spread, with a standard deviation of
2.5% for the Calabi-Yau data and 1.2% for the Wigner+Wishart matrices (see Figure 20). For

explained in the main text.

a more meaningful comparison we therefore rescale the mean fraction of negative eigenvalues
by the standard deviation of the corresponding distribution. Repeating this analysis for several different threefolds at different values of h1,1 yields Figure 21. We find that the rescaled
fraction of negative eigenvalues generally increases more quickly with h1,1 in the threefold
examples than it does in Wigner+Wishart or Wigner reference models. Although this proxy
is suggestive of decreased metastability, a more precise result requires detailed study of the
full Hessian that incorporates superpotential data.

Other string theories

In all of the above, we focused on the properties of the Hessian on the Kähler moduli space of
O3/O7 orientifolds of a Calabi-Yau threefold, in which the Kähler coordinates are complexifications of 4-cycle volumes. In other corners of the landscape, including the heterotic string,
O5/O9 projections of type IIB, and O6 projections of type IIA, the complexified Kähler moduli are complexifications of 2-cycle volumes, J + i B2 = ̺i ωi (in O5/O9 projections, C2 rather
than B2 is used). Our methods readily apply to these constructions, and it is interesting to

as in the O3/O7 projection of type IIB, we find extended tails. One noteworthy difference

CY′ exhibits corresponding positive tails. We defer a more complete consideration of

Reference Models

In the previous sections, we identified key statistical properties of the Kähler metrics and
curvature Hessians HR arising in compactifications on (orientifolds of) explicit Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The presence of extensive tails — toward positivity for Kab̄ ,
CY — is the most striking feature of these ensembles.

Wigner+Wishart data were gathered from ensembles of 5000 matrices at each point, while
the Calabi-Yau data were gathered from ensembles of 5 threefolds at each h1,1 with 1000
Hessians from each threefold.

i.i.d. model, however, does have the important virtues of simplicity and extremely low computational cost in comparison to the analysis described in this paper. It would be instructive
to identify a stochastic model that shares some of the simplicity of the i.i.d. Wigner+Wishart
model, but more accurately models the geometry of Calabi-Yau moduli spaces. In this section
we will describe several candidate models for HR , among which the Bergman metric discussed
in §6.3 has the most qualitative success, though in its simplest form it lacks the heavy tails
of the Calabi-Yau spectrum.
6.1

Random intersection numbers

A central result of this paper is that correlations between the various contributions to the
Hessian will impact the features of the eigenvalue spectrum. Although we focused on the
particular example of O3/O7 orientifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds, correlations should be
a universal feature, and further elucidation of their effect could be obtained by a study of

for almost all choices of cabc , and for almost all points in the space spanned by ta , the
metric following from (6.1) has negative eigenvalues. Finding the interior of the Kähler cone
numerically is then very difficult. In fact there is no guarantee that the Kähler cone will not
be empty for a generic set of random intersection numbers.10

Further refinement could be obtained by incorporating the consistency requirements for the intersection
numbers on a Calabi-Yau discussed in [30].

Random positive Riemann curvature

The components Rab̄cd¯ of the Riemann tensors on the Kähler moduli spaces that we study
are nearly always positive. An ad hoc modification of the i.i.d. approach would be to impose
positivity on the i.i.d. components. We accomplish this in a very crude way by generating an
ensemble of Riemann tensors by adding i.i.d. K(3) and K(4) contributions and then taking the
absolute values of the resulting tensor components. This prescription yields an ensemble of
i.i.d.+
which manifest an increased correlation between the curvature tensors (Figmatrices HR
ure 15c). Correspondingly, the curvature Hessian spectrum displays a tail towards negativity
as shown in Figure 23. However, these features are not as pronounced as in the Calabi-Yau
case.
6.3

Random Bergman metrics

A construction that allows for a definition of a random Kähler potential is the Bergman
metric, which comes from the embedding of compact Kähler manifolds into projective space
along the lines of Kodaira.11 In practice, the Bergman metric on a Kähler manifold with
coordinates z i is specified by the Kähler potential:
K(z, z) =


1
log f z, z̄ ,
k


f z, z̄ := s̄α (z̄)Pαβ sβ (z) ,

(6.2)

in which {sα (z)} is a basis of polynomials of degree ≤ k and P is a positive-definite Hermitian
matrix. f is called the Bergman kernel. A particular Bergman metric is defined by a choice
of positive-definite matrix Pαβ , and by taking the entries of this matrix to be i.i.d., one can
construct a random Bergman metric, in the spirit of [9].
11

See [31] for a mathematical review.

– 34 –

One might be tempted to use (6.2) to construct an ensemble of metrics that scale homogeneously under z i → λz i , and thereby model the homogeneous metrics on the moduli space
of a Calabi-Yau. However, positive-definiteness of the Bergman metric is only guaranteed
when P is positive-definite, and in particular is not degenerate. Indeed, if P is such that f
is a homogeneous function under z i → λz i , then the resulting metric is degenerate.12 More
generally, if P were not positive-definite, then the metric would only be positive-definite in
certain regions in moduli space, and finding such regions is computationally difficult when
the dimension of the space is large.
One way to study a Bergman metric is to fix the matrix P , and then scan over a neighborhood in the coordinates z i . However, when z i z̄ ī is large and k is finite, the kernel is
dominated by the largest-power monomials in the basis, and so f is well-approximated by a
homogeneous function of degree 2k. As discussed above, homogeneous kernels are degenerate,
and so the metric is guaranteed to have singularities for sufficiently large z.
An alternative to exploring a small region with a fixed kernel is to generate a new Pαβ
at each point in moduli space, and then redefine the coordinates such that the point under
consideration is z i = 0. The philosophy is quite similar to the i.i.d. approach in that we
assume that we work with an ensemble of Hessians generated at points in moduli space that
have a separation that is large in comparison to the correlation length of P . Therefore, as
in the i.i.d. approach, we lose information about correlations between Hessians at different
points but retain correlations between the various derivatives of the Kähler potential at each
point.13 Since calculation of the Riemann tensor of a Kähler metric requires no more than
two holomorphic or anti-holomorphic derivatives (see (2.6)) and we are evaluating all tensors
at z = 0, we can take the sα to be quadratic polynomials.
We now consider an ensemble of Bergman metrics as described above, taking P to be a
random Wishart matrix. The Riemann tensor can be calculated entirely in terms of Pαβ . In

curvature invariants are small, the tails are not as extensive as in the Calabi-Yau case. Indeed,
repeating the analysis in §5.3, we find no significant evidence for the tails to be heavy.14
The Bergman metric has features that make it appealing as a model for moduli space
metrics: it incorporates the correlations between K(3) and K(4) , and appears to have similar
relationships between R and R as in the Calabi-Yau case. However, although fluctuations

Spectra of Axion Decay Constants

A significant application of our results is to the problem of determining axion decay constants.
The axion decay constant spectrum is relevant for a wide range of questions, including analysis
of the “axiverse” proposed in [32], the study of axion dark matter, late time decays, etc. For
the particular purpose of developing models of inflation in string theory, it is important to
understand whether axion decay constants can reach or exceed the Planck scale, f & Mpl .
While axion decay constants in string theory have been the subject of intensive study (see [15]
and the overview in [33]), most results to date have involved either single axions; pairs of
axions; or, in systems with N ≫ 1 axions, “democratic” estimates in which the N decay
constants are taken to be essentially comparable and uncorrelated [34, 35]. Here we initiate
a more systematic study of the statistics of axion decay constants, incorporating the critical
phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion.
In a compactification of type IIB string theory on a Calabi-Yau orientifold with O3-plane
and O7-plane fixed loci, the intersection numbers determine the classical effective action for
the Kähler moduli ρa = τ a + i ca , including in particular the axions15

C4 .
(7.1)

The kinetic term for these axions is given by the Kähler metric Kab̄ (3.12a): taking the τ a to
be constants, the low-energy Lagrangian includes

L ⊃ Kab̄ (τ c ) ∂ca ∂cb −
Λ4a (τ c ) cos(ca /ζa ) .

where the potential term represents instanton contributions that break the perturbative shift
symmetries ca → ca + const. to discrete shifts ca → ca + 2πζa . In the absence of a preferred
basis for the Kähler moduli space, one could rescale the ρa to arrange that each of the ca has
period 2π, i.e. setting ζa → 1, but we will not do so here: instead, the metric Kab̄ (τ c ) is taken
to be expressed in the basis used throughout this work.
Determining the decay constant f in a model with h1,1

The periodicity of the canonically-normalized field φ is then 2πf ζ. As explained in [36], in
generalizing this result to multiple axions one must carefully account for kinetic mixing, i.e.
off-diagonal terms Kab̄ , b 6= a: the orthogonal rotation that diagonalizes Kab̄ does not preserve
the form of the potential in (7.2), in which each field appears in only a single cosine term in
the potential. Nevertheless, we will define the decay constants in an N -axion system to be
√
the (positive square roots of the) eigenvalues λa of the Kähler metric: fa = λa . We will
order the eigenvalues for convenience, f1 ≤ f2 ≤ . . . ≤ fN , with N = h1,1 .
A natural goal would be to derive a matrix model for the Kähler metric analogous to
the Wigner+Wishart+Wishart matrix model for the Hessian obtained in [10], and to obtain
analytic results for the eigenvalue spectrum, and hence for the spectrum of decay constants.
This problem is beyond the scope of the present work, and we limit ourselves to conclusions
that can be extracted from the ensemble of Kähler metrics presented in §5.
For the purpose of characterizing the spectra of axion decay constants, the principal
qualitative lesson of our analysis is that the eigenvalue spectrum of the Kähler metric displays
a pronounced tail to the right of the median. Because the extreme eigenvalues are very
different from typical eigenvalues, a computation (or an estimate of the moduli dependence
of) an individual decay constant f⋆ , along the lines of [15], does not directly constrain the
full spectrum. In particular, depending on whether f⋆ is a typical member of the spectrum,
or belongs to the left or right tail, the remaining decay constants may extend over several
decades in either direction.
Large outliers, i.e. decay constants belonging to the right tail of the spectrum, provide
the tantalizing prospect of achieving super-Planckian decay constants in a compactification in
which all parametric expansions are under good control, and typical decay constants are very
small in Planck units. However, although super-Planckian effective decay constants appear
possible via collective excitations in systems with N ≫ 1 axions [34] (and can be enlarged
via kinetic alignment as in [36]) or via decay constant alignment [37] of two axions, in neither
of these cases is a super-Planckian eigenvalue of the Kähler metric responsible for the large
decay constant. In generic examples in the interior of the Kähler cone, the parametric bound
f . 1 of [15] appears to apply to the maximal eigenvalues fN in our ensemble, not to the
typical eigenvalues. Identifying non-generic exceptions with super-Planckian decay constants,
while ensuring the validity of the α′ expansion, is an intriguing problem for future work.

Conclusions

The primary results of this work are statistical models for the metric on Kähler moduli
space in string compactifications on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties, and for the
corresponding Riemann curvature contribution HR to the Hessian matrix.16 Our starting
point was the assumption made in [10] (and implicitly in much earlier work) that for the
purpose of studying vacuum statistics, the derivatives of K may be taken to be independent
and identically distributed random variables. At the level of random matrix models, assuming
i.i.d. entries allows one to model HR as the sum of a Wishart matrix and a Wigner matrix

than a statistical description of the entire eigenvalue spectrum, which does require additional

are not caused by failure of the α′ expansion: heavy tails are present when there are modest
hierarchies in cycle volumes, even if all cycles are large in string units.

Our results shed light on the characteristic properties of mass matrices and metrics on
moduli space in Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory. We discussed two signifiCY very plausibly leads to an
cant implications: first, the heavy tail toward negativity in HR
WW . Second, the
increased incidence of instabilities in comparison to the reference model HR
heavy tails in the eigenvalues of the Kähler metric imply that in Calabi-Yau compactifications
with many axions, the axion decay constants are hierarchically separated, with the largest
eigenvalue orders of magnitude larger than the smallest eigenvalue.
Exploring the consequences of these findings, as well as extending our results to broader
classes of compactifications, are important problems for the future.

Toric Geometry

In this appendix we provide a brief review of the aspects of toric varieties and Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces that are used in our work. For more complete expositions of toric varieties
see [4, 39–43].
A physical definition of a toric variety is as the moduli space of a 2d N = (2, 2) field
theory. In general, the moduli space of such a theory is a Kähler manifold. To specialize
to a toric variety, we consider a U(1)s gauge group and r chiral superfields X i , where the
charge of the ith chiral superfield under the ath U(1) factor is Qai . Each U(1) factor has a
Fayet-Iliopoulos term ξ a , so that the D-flatness condition is
X
Qai X i = ξ a .
(A.1)
i

The resulting moduli space is a toric variety.
A useful collection of divisors are the toric divisors T̂ i defined by X i = 0. Because of the
U(1)s gauge symmetry, the coordinates X i on Cr , known as homogeneous coordinates, are
not functions on the toric variety. On the other hand, gauge-invariant combinations of the
X i are well-defined functions, and the corresponding vanishing loci are homologically trivial.
Thus, not all of the toric divisors T̂ i are homologically independent, and indeed the number
of independent divisors is equal to the rank of the gauge group. We will use {D̂ i } to refer to
a set of independent toric divisors. To our knowledge, there is no natural or canonical basis
choice for the D̂ i , and we work in the bases adopted in the software packages that we use.
The intersection numbers among the toric divisors T̂ i (and therefore the independent divisors
D̂ i ) can be calculated by simultaneously solving X i = 0 subject to the D-term constraint.

has vanishing first Chern class, and so is Calabi-Yau. Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces of the
form (A.3) are the only Calabi-Yau manifolds considered in our analysis.
The intersections of toric divisors D̂ a with the Calabi-Yau hypersurface furnish divisors
of the hypersurface. When all of the divisors of the Calabi-Yau are inherited from the ambient
toric variety in this way, the polytope is said to be favorable, and we limit our analysis to
such cases. One can easily check whether a polytope is favorable by calculating h1,1 from the
toric data [44].
The classes of holomorphic curves in an n-dimensional toric variety form a cone called the
Mori cone, which can be determined by considering the intersections of (n − 1) toric divisors.
The Mori cone is generated by a set of curves Ĉi , and the intersections between the divisors
of the toric variety and these curves are given by the charge matrix
Qai = Ĉi · D̂ a .

(A.4)

Note that the Mori cone of the Calabi-Yau is not in general the same as the Mori cone of
the ambient toric variety. For example, if a curve of the ambient variety does not intersect
the Calabi-Yau hypersurface, then the curve may be safely taken to zero volume and even be
allowed to flop.19 However, positivity of curves of the ambient space implies positivity of the
curves of the hypersurface.20
The data of a compact toric variety can be encoded by a polytope, which is a higherdimensional generalization of a polyhedron. We will consider n-dimensional polytopes ∆ that
are reflexive, meaning that the only point of Zn that is in the interior of ∆ is the origin, and
that ∆ can be expressed as an intersection of half-spaces
\
m ∈ Rn | m · nF ≥ −1 ,
(A.5)
∆=
F

where F denotes a codimension-1 face of ∆, and nF is the shortest vector in Zn that is an
inward-facing normal to F . Given a polytope ∆, its dual polytope ∆◦ is defined by taking
the points nF as the vertices of ∆◦ . When ∆ is reflexive, ∆◦ is reflexive.
The next step is to triangulate ∆◦ : that is, we divide ∆◦ into simplices. In particular, we
consider triangulations of ∆◦ that are star, which means that all simplices share one common
19

It has been conjectured that after taking into account this additional freedom, the Kähler cone of a
Calabi-Yau will always be simplicial (see, for example, [41]).

point as a vertex. For our purposes this point will be the origin, as each simplex defines a
cone with the tip being the origin, and one can form a fan by pasting together such cones. To
each line segment vi that connects to the origin, we associate one of the variables X i . The
vi satisfy a set of linear relations,
Qai vi = 0 ,
(A.6)
which give the charge matrices. Note that there are multiple ways of triangulating a polytope,
and thus a polytope does not define a unique toric variety. However, the various varieties are
related to each other via blowups and blow-downs.
A necessary condition for a non-empty Kähler cone is that the triangulation is regular,
meaning that the triangulation is a projection of the bottom part of an (n + 1)-dimensional
polytope. More precisely, let {mk } be the points of the triangulation of ∆. Then the triangulation is regular if there exists an (n + 1)-dimensional polytope Ξ containing points (mk , λk )
whose inward-facing normals have positive (n + 1)-dimensional components.
Toric varieties are generally singular, but when the triangulation is maximal, meaning
that every point in Zn that is in ∆ is a vertex of a simplex of the triangulation, then the
variety becomes smooth. In such a situation, the Calabi-Yau hypersurface will also be smooth.
In fact, total smoothness of the variety is not necessary to ensure smoothness of a generic
hypersurface: at generic points in the complex structure moduli space of the Calabi-Yau, the
hypersurface will miss pointlike singularities of the ambient variety. Thus, our triangulations
need not include the points in the interior of codimension-1 faces (facets) of the polytope.
We are therefore led to consider complete regular star triangulations of favorable reflexive
polytopes, ignoring points interior to facets.

B

Triangulation Algorithm

A common way to obtain complete, regular, star triangulations is to calculate all complete,
regular triangulations and then select those that are star. This is extremely inefficient if one
is interested only in star triangulations. In order to directly obtain triangulations that are
star, we recall that by definition, each point in a star triangulation is connected to the origin
by a line. One can therefore obtain a complete star triangulation by triangulating each of
the facets, drawing a line from the origin to each point on the facets, and enforcing that the
triangulations of each facet agree on the overlaps of facets.
The resulting triangulation is automatically maximal and star, but it is still necessary to
check for regularity. We present our algorithm below, illustrated for concreteness in the case
of a polytope P with four facets, Fa , Fb , Fc , and Fd :
1. Find all regular, complete triangulations of each facet. We obtained these triangulations
from TOPCOM [46], using Sage as an interface.
2. Organize the facets into pairs, such that each facet in a pair has nonzero intersection
with its partner. If facets Fa and Fb intersect, and facets Fc and Fd intersect, create
the pairs (Fa , Fb ) and (Fc , Fd ).

Facet 2

Figure 26: Facet 1 and Facet 2 are three-dimensional facets of a four-dimensional polytope.
The facets overlap along the surface habcdi.

3. For each pair of facets, compare the triangulations of each member of the pair on
the intersection, retaining only those triangulations that are regular and agree on the
overlap. That is, let S be the overlap of the facets Fa and Fb , and let ∆a and ∆b be
triangulations of facets Fa and Fb , respectively. Determine whether ∆a and ∆b agree
on S, and whether ∆a ∪ ∆b := ∆ab is regular (including the lines drawn to the origin).
Retain ∆ab if and only if it is regular. Repeat this process for all other pairs of facets.
4. Combine Fa and Fb into a single intermediate polytope Fab with regular triangulations
{∆iab }, and combine Fc and Fd into an intermediate polytope Fcd with regular triangu′
lations {∆icd }. Do the same for all other pairs of facets.
5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for the new pairs, such as (Fab , Fcd ), until the full polytope is
triangulated.
The above method yields all complete, regular, star triangulations of the polytope P . We
will illustrate step 2 in toy example. Consider a four-dimensional polytope, where two of the
facets are cubes that overlap on a square surface. In Figure 26 we show the two facets that
overlap along the surface habcdi.
After triangulating each facet individually, we need to ensure that the triangulations
agree on their overlap. Consider triangulations of facet 1 and facet 2, labeled ∆1 and ∆2 ,
respectively. If ∆1 and ∆2 induce the same triangulation on habcdi, as shown in Figure 27,
then the pair of triangulations is good, and we store the pair. If instead the triangulations
do not agree on the overlap, as in Figure 28, we discard the pair.
A challenge in the above algorithm is that storing all possible pairs of triangulations
at each step becomes costly for h1,1 & 15. To access a subset of complete, regular, star

triangulations in examples with larger h1,1 , one can keep only a subset of the possible pairs
at each step, in the following way.
1. Start with two overlapping facets Fa and Fb , and determine all regular triangulations
of each. Of the regular triangulations of each facet that agree on the overlap, retain the
first j1 pairs, for some number j1 .
2. Form the intermediate polytope Fab .
3. Select another overlapping facet Fc , and compute all regular triangulations of Fc . Compare each of these to the j triangulations of Fab , retaining the first j2 triangulations of
Fc that agree with a triangulation of Fab on the overlap of Fab with Fc , and that are
regular.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, adding in facets, until one has obtained one or more triangulations
of the full polytope.
Since one only keeps jk pairs at step k, this second method is not guaranteed to yield a
triangulation of the full polytope: one can obtain pairs early on for which there is no regular

completion of the triangulation. Even so, this method is much faster than the available
alternatives, particularly if the jk are chosen to be small. We have used this approach to
obtain complete, regular, star triangulations of polytopes with h1,1 as large as 25 on a desktop
computer. For h1,1 & 25 even triangulating the individual facets becomes expensive, and more
sophisticated tools are required to obtain triangulations.
We note that our method of triangulation is most successful with polytopes that have
many facets. In typical cases, the more facets there are, the fewer triangulations each facet
admits, so that the time to triangulate each individual facet is decreased. This gives the
algorithm more opportunities to fail at each step, but since the method is fast once all of
the facet triangulations are found, we nevertheless find the greatest success for many-faceted
polytopes.
After a triangulation is found the resulting fan can be provided as input to Sage, which
then constructs the corresponding toric variety data, including the intersection ring and Mori
cone generators of the ambient toric space. The intersection ring can then be pulled back to
the Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
