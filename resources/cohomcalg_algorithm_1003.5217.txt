We present an algorithm for computing line bundle valued cohomology classes over toric varieties. This is the
basic starting point for computing massless modes in both heterotic and Type IIB/F-theory compactifications, where the manifolds of interest are complete intersections of hypersurfaces in toric varieties supporting
additional vector bundles.

INTRODUCTION

It is clear that the computation of line bundle cohomology classes over D-dimensional varieties is an interesting
mathematical question of its own. Our motivation for
approaching this problem, however, originates from the
appearance of this problem in various classes of compactifications of string theory.
First of all, in supersymmetric compactifications of the
heterotic string from ten to four space-time dimensions,
the massless spectrum is given by certain cohomology

b) bjurke@mppmu.mpg.de
c) rahn@mppmu.mpg.de
d) roschy@mppmu.mpg.de

classes H i (Y ; V ) of the vector bundle V over a CalabiYau three-fold Y . The largest class of such Calabi-Yau
threefolds is given by complete intersections over toric
ambient varieties X. For the vector bundles various constructions have been discussed in the literature. The
three most prominent ones are, on the one hand, monad
and extension constructions, for which the vector bundle
is defined via (exact) sequences of direct sums of line bundles. On the other hand, for elliptically fibered CalabiYau manifolds, the spectral cover construction provides
a large class of stable holomorphic vector bundles. However, in all three cases, the computation of the massless
spectrum, i.e. of vector bundle cohomology classes, boils
down to determine the cohomology H i (X; L) of line bundles L over toric ambient varieties X. Therefore, it is
pretty obvious that it would be important to have a tool
to determine these line bundle cohomology classes in a
straightforward way, i.e. without invoking any manifold
dependent tricks.
The same problem also appears in other kinds of string
compactification like Type IIB orientifolds with B-type
D-branes or in F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau
fourfolds. Here one is confronted for instance with computing line bundle cohomology classes over curves, which
arise due to the intersection of seven-brane wrapped divisors on a three-dimensional compact internal manifold.
Such cohomology classes count both the charged matter
zero modes and instanton zero modes in case one of the
seven-branes is a Euclidean three-brane instanton.
In the string theory literature, some indications how
such a generalization of Bott’s theorem to general toric
spaces might look like implicitly appeared in the papers1
and2 , however to our knowledge the algorithm used
in those papers was never really completely revealed.3
More recently, it was in the mathematics literature that
the problem was systematically approached and solved4 .
However, it appears to us that the algorithm used in1,2
is much easier and economical, so that now, after nontrivially extending it to its most generic form, we find it
appropriate to eventually reveal it.
In this letter we will proceed by motivating the
algorithm by a couple of non-trivial examples based on
direct computations of the Čech cohomology. Then the
algorithm is formulated as a conjecture (which is so

2
simple that it fits less than a single page). We postpone
the computation of vector bundle cohomologies and
many further string theoretic applications to a more
extensive paper5 .

ALGORITHM FOR LINE BUNDLE COHOMOLOGY

In this section we will present an algorithm for the
computation of line bundle cohomologies H i (X; O(D))
over a toric variety X. We will motivate the algorithm
following the original development. The final conjecture
is given in section II E.
A.

Preliminaries

To define the framework we are working in, let us
briefly summarize some facts about toric varieties respectively, their physical counter part, the gauged linear
sigma models (GLSM).
A toric variety is a generalization of projective spaces,
which contains a set of homogeneous coordinates H :=
{xi : i = 1, . . . , I} equipped with a number R of equivalence relations

xI ),

(1)

(r)

for r = 1, . . . , R with the weights Qi ∈ Z and λr ∈ C∗ =
C− {0}. We will always assume that the weights are chosen such that one really gets a bona fide toric space. A
powerful method to study such spaces is the GLSM6 , in
which the homogeneous coordinates are chiral superfields
(r)
and the Qi are charges under R Abelian U (1) gauge
symmetries in a two-dimensional N = (2, 2) supersymmetric gauge theory. The Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters ξr
of these U (1) gauge symmetries, can be interpreted as
the Kähler parameters of the geometric space.
The vanishing of the D-terms of a GLSM then splits
the space of Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters ξ~ ∈ RR into
R-dimensional cones, in which the D-flatness conditions
can be solved. These cones are also called phases and
correspond geometrically to the Kähler cones. In each
such cone, for the D-terms to be solvable one finds sets
of collections of coordinates

with α = 1, . . . , N , (2)
Sα = xα1 , xα2 , . . . , xα|Sα |
which are not allowed to simultaneously vanish. The toric
variety of dimension D = I − R in this phase is then
defined as
X=

Note that the more physical definition of a toric variety
given here is equivalent to the one in terms of cones, fans
and triangulations. A choice of a phase corresponds to
the choice of a triangulation of the polytope defined via
the I vertices νi ∈ ZD . These vertices satisfy the R linear

For further introductions to toric geometry consult7–11
or for a more mathematical treatment12,13 .
Given such a toric space, the hypersurface {xi = 0}
naturally defines a divisor Di of X. By the relation of
divisors and line bundles summarized in appendix A 4,
this also defines a line bundle Li = OX (Di ), which we
also denote as

In order to compute, for instance, the vector bundle cohomology H q (X; TX ), one needs as input only the line
bundle cohomology classes H q (X; OX (Di )) with q =
0, . . . , D.
The determination of these cohomology classes for general line bundles L = OX (k1 , . . . , kR ) is the problem we
will address in this letter. Due to the Riemann-RochHirzebruch theorem, the cohomology classes H q (X; L)
satisfy an index theorem (see appendix A 5)

the intersection form on X is known.
The simplest toric varieties are the projective spaces
Pn , for which F = {x1 = x2 = . . . = xn+1 = 0}. For
these spaces, the line bundle cohomology is known due

Čech cohomology for P2

To motivate the algorithm, we consider a simple example for which the Čech cohomology can really be computed with pencil and paper.
We want to compute the Čech cohomology of P2 . First
we need a suitable covering by open sets, which for this
projective space is provided by

(11)
Ui := [x1 : x2 : x3 ] ∈ P2 : xi 6= 0 .
Then the Čech cochains for the covering UP2
{U1 , U2 , U3 } take the form

=

Č 0 (UP2 ; F ) = F (U1 ) ⊕ F (U2 ) ⊕ F (U3 )
Č 1 (UP2 ; F ) = F (U12 ) ⊕ F (U23 ) ⊕ F (U13 )

(12)

2

Č (UP2 ; F ) = F (U123 ),
where we used the abbreviation Uij...k = Ui ∩Uj ∩· · ·∩Uk .
Now we consider a line bundle F = O(−p) with p > 0
and compute the local sections on all open sets, where the
homogeneous coordinates which are non-vanishing can
appear with a negative exponent. This leads to
• Ui : an element of F (Ui ) is of the form

(13)

These monomials can be represented by points lying in different regions Ri in the (m1 , m2 )-plane,
cf. figure 1.

• Ui ∩Uj : an element of F (Ui )∩F (Uj ) is of the form


m + m ≤ −p for U ∩ U

The corresponding regions are denoted by Rij in
the (m1 , m2 )-plane.
• U1 ∩U2 ∩U3 : an element of F (U1 )∩F (U2 )∩F (U3 )
is of the form
m2 −p−m1 −m2
1
,
xm
1 x2 x3
2
with (m1 , m2 ) ∈ Z .

(15)

This means that R123 is the whole plane.
Now one has to distinguish the various regions in
the (m1 , m2 ) plane shown in figure 1. Computing the
cohomology of the Čech complex for those regions is
straightforward. For (m1 , m2 ) ∈ Ri each section of
Č 0 (UP2 ; F ) restricts to two sets from Č 1 (UP2 ; F ), which

meant
S that we
S have the inclusions Ri ∪ Rj ⊂ Rij for i < j
and i Ri ∪ i<j Rij ⊂ R123 , where R123 covers the entire
lattice space.

by itself restricts to Č 2 (UP2 ; F ). Thus we get a sequence
0 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 0 with trivial cohomology. An
element (m1 , m2 ) ∈ Rij \ Ri ∪ Rj first contributes to
Č 1 (UP2 ; F ) and restricts to Č 2 (UP2 ; F ). The induced
sequence 0 → 0 → 1 → 1 → 0 again has trivial cohomology. Finally, if

(16)
Rij ∪
(m1 , m2 ) ∈ R123 \
i<j

i

we get a sequence 0 → 0 → 0 → 1 → 0 which contributes
one element to the second cohomology.
Thus we have computed that the dimension of the cohomology H 2 (P2 ; O(−p)) for p > 0 is given by the number of points lying in the interior triangle in the picture,
i.e. the complement of the union of all other sets. Now,
we observe that the number of these points is precisely
the number of all rational functions of the form
1
x1 x2 x3 W (x1 , x2 , x3 )

with

deg(W ) = p − 3 , (17)

where W is in fact only a monomial instead of a generic
polynomial. From this point on we will refer to rational
functions with both monomials in the numerator and denominator as “rationoms”.
This readily yields the result

h2 (P2 ; O(−p)) = p−1
,
which
is equal to Bott’s formula.
2
The crucial observation is now that the combination
{x1 x2 x3 } is nothing else than the Stanley-Reisner ideal
of P2 . Therefore, there seems to be a connection between
such rationoms with the elements of the Stanley-Reisner
ideal in the denominator and the dimensions of line bundle cohomology classes.

4
One can study more complicated examples and always
finds a similar relationship between the representatives
of Čech cohomology and rationoms of the above form.
This observation leads to the following first version of
our conjecture, which does not yet cover the most generic
situation. However, it was this form which was sufficient
to find all the cohomology classes in1,2 .

D.

Further examples

To get an idea of how this algorithm works in more
involved cases and where its restrictions are, we now apply this conjecture to del Pezzo surfaces arising from a
certain number of blowups of P2 .

C.

A preliminary algorithm conjecture

For the moment we assume that all elements of the
Stanley-Reisner ideal are disjoint, i.e. no homogeneous
coordinate xi appears in more than one Sα .
In order to determine which rationoms contribute to
which cohomology, we have to consider the power set
of SR, which we denote as P (SR). Clearly we have a
splitting of the form
|SR|

P (SR) =

[

Pk (SR),

(18)

k=0

where Pk (SR) contains all subsets of SR with k elements.
k
Let A = {α1 , . . . , αk } ⊂ {1, . . . , |SR|} and PA
=
{Sα1 , . . . , Sαk } ∈ Pk (SR) be such an element of P (SR)
containing k elements. We now define the set
QkA :=

k
[

Sαi

(19)

k
of all homogeneous coordinates appearing in PA
and the

c-degree

k
[

Sαi − k.

(20)

i=1

The question now is to which cohomology class does a
fixed element Q = QkA with N = NAk contribute.
Preliminary Conjecture:: One gets a contribution to
H N (X, O(D)), which is given just by counting appropriate rationoms, where ~y ∈ Q are the denominator variables and ~x ∈ H − Q the complementary
numerator variables. The contribution of Q to the
line bundle cohomology is given by:
H N (X; O(D)) :

To get an idea of the simplicity of the counting procedure once the form of the contributing monomials has
been determined, we first look at dP1 with toric data
given in table I. Note that the condition on the elements
of the Stanley-Reisner ideal is fulfilled, i.e. they are disjoint. We will see what may happen for more complicated
Stanley-Reisner ideals later.

yj ) · W (~y )

.

(21)

T (~x) and W (~y ) are monomials of the right degree
to match the weights of D in the line bundle O(D),
i.e. one counts the number of suitable monomials T
and W .
Now, doing this for all elements in the power set P (SR),
one determines the complete line bundle cohomology.
The whole cohomology computation has been reduced to
a counting problem, in which the Stanley-Reisner ideal
plays an important role. Clearly, this algorithm can easily be computerized.

TABLE I. Toric data for the del Pezzo-1 surface

Forming the power set of the Stanley-Reisner ideal directly yields the following possible contributions to cohomology, where the line bundle O(D) = O(m, n) is given
by the divisor D = mH + nX.
H 0 (dP1 ; O(m, n)) :

T (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) ,
T (x3 , x4 )
H 1 (dP1 ; O(m, n)) :
,
x1 x2 · W (x1 , x2 )
T (x1 , x2 )
,
x3 x4 · W (x3 , x4 )
1
H 2 (dP1 ; O(m, n)) :
.
x1 x2 x3 x4 · W (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
(22)
In fact, we would not have to take H 2 (dP1 ; O(m, n))
into account because of Serre duality, but it will serve as
a good test of the procedure to check that it is obeyed
at the end of the computation. Note that the rationoms
representing the top cohomology
Q class always involve the
denominator monomial Q =
xi of all homogeneous
coordinates xi ∈ H, which is a clear evidence of Serre
duality in
P “monomial” form, since the canonical class
K = − Di is the negative sum of all coordinate divisor classes.
In order to get the dimensions of all cohomology
groups, one only has to read off the charges of the coordinates from the table to get the degrees of the respective

5
monomials, equate them to the degrees (m, n) of the line
bundle and do the remaining combinatorics, i.e. count all
possible exponents. Writing hi (m, n) for the dimension
of H i (dP1 ; O(m, n)) and kxi k for the exponent of the coordinate xi in the monomials T and W these steps can
be schematically described as follows:
• Contributions to h0 (m, n) from all combinations of
exponents with
deg T (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
= (kx1 k + kx2 k + kx3 k , kx3 k + kx4 k)

It is easy to check that Serre duality holds. Since the
canonical divisor is given by the negative sum over all divisors corresponding to the one-dimensional cones (vertices) of the fan
X
Dρ ,
(28)
K =−
ρ∈Σ(1)

we get K = −3H − 2X from the table of dP1 . Serre
duality can then be written as
H i (dP1 ; O(m, n))
∼
= H 2−i (dP1 ; O(K) ⊗ O(m, n)∨ )

(23)

!

= (m, n) .
Since the exponents cannot be negative, we only
get contributions for m ≥ 0 and n ≥ 0. Defining

Equating the right hand sides to (m, n), this yields
the two cases
1. n ≥ 0 ∧ n ≥ m + 2:

− 2 − kx3 k − kx4 k) .

And indeed, the computed dimensions obviously satisfy
the identity
hi (m, n) = h2−i (−m − 3, −n − 2) .

(30)

In this case the computation could still be performed
just with pencil and paper but clearly for more involved
higher dimensional cases a computer code is necessary.14

So let’s make two steps further and look at dP3 , the del
Pezzo surface of degree 6 coming from three consecutive
blowups of P2 . This is the first example we considered,
for which nontrivial “region factors” arise from Čech cohomology. Its toric data are given in Table II.

TABLE II. Toric data for the del Pezzo-3 surface.

First of all, the elements of the Stanley-Reisner ideal
are no longer disjoint. So by our definition of c-degree,
2
e.g. the element P{1,4}
= {x1 x2 , x2 x3 } of P2 (SR) would
now contribute to the first cohomology, since the union
is
Q := Q2{1,4} = {x1 , x2 , x3 }

(31)

6
2
and therefore N{1,4}
= 3−2 = 1. There are also two other
combinations in P2 (SR) with the same union, namely
2
2
P{2,4}
= {x1 x3 , x2 x3 } and P{1,2}
= {x1 x2 , x1 x3 }. This
by itself is not a problem, but one further finds out that
the c-degree of Q is not unique any more, since the el3
ement P{1,2,4}
= {x1 x2 , x1 x3 , x2 x3 } of P3 (SR) has the
3
same union but now gives N{1,2,4}
= 3 − 3 = 0. Of course
one could hope that this kind of combinatorial structure
of the power set is meaningless and a certain element Q
only contributes to the cohomology of highest c-degree.
As it turns out, this assumption is too naive, since it
leads to inconsistencies for example when computing the
holomorphic Euler characteristic of line bundles, which
can also be computed by means of index theorems and is
another useful quantity to cross-check results. Choosing
O(D) with D = −3H − X − Y − Z (equal to the degree
−1 −1
of x−1
1 x2 x3 ), computing the Todd class of dP3 , the
Chern character of the line bundle and doing the integral
over X by means of the intersection form, one readily
calculates

χ(dP3 ; O(D))

(32)

and since h0 (O(D)) = h2 (O(D)) = 0 we get h1 (O(D)) =
2. But performing our algorithm, the only contribution
−1 −1
comes from the rationom x−1
1 x2 x3 , so it clearly fails.
The rationom must be weighted by a factor of two and the
question is how this can be incorporated in the counting
algorithm.
A possible solution is to introduce a sort of “cohomological” sequence that imitates a cochain complex without specifying the mappings and encodes the additional
structure of P (SR) alluded to before. In the case of Q
this yields
. . . −→ 0 −→ |{z}
C0 −→ |{z}
C1 −→ 0 −→ . . . .
=1

(33)

and therefore a remnant or secondary cohomology h =
3 − 1 = 2 acting as a factor for all corresponding rationoms, allowing us to schematically write the contribution of Q to line bundle cohomology as
2×

T (x4 , x5 , x6 )
, (34)
x1 x2 x3 · W (x1 , x2 , x3 )

where the monomials T and W have to be chosen such
that the rationom has the same degree as D. Since it
can be shown that this procedure is suited to reproduce
the right factors in many more nontrivial examples including higher-dimensional varieties, this motivates the
formulation of a more general version of our conjectured
algorithm.

where A runs over all subsets of {1, . . . , |SR|} with k elements. The question now is to which cohomology class
does a fixed denominator monomial Q contribute. To
decide this one computes a “remnant” or “secondary”
cohomology Hi (Q). For its definition, one counts how
often the element Q appears in each Qk and with what
c-degree. Then we can associate the numbers Ci (Q) to
such a Q, where Ci (Q) is the number of times the element
Q appears in all Qk with c-degree i.

one gets a contribution to H i (X; O(D)), which is
given by counting rationoms

where ~y ∈ Q are the denominator variables and
~x ∈ H −Q the numerator variables. T (~x) and W (~y )
have to be taken as monomials of the right degree
to match the degree of O(D). The total number of
these has then to be weighted by a factor of hi (Q).

The final algorithm conjecture

To formulate it we have to refine the set-theoretic notions from the first version of the conjecture. In order

Actually, due to Serre duality it is sufficient to consider only the cohomologies H i (X; O(D)) with i ∈
{0, 1, . . . , [ d2 ]}. We have not really been precise about

7
what the maps in (39) are and therefore have not shown
that this is indeed a complex. More mathematical work
needs to be done to precisely define this “remnant” cohomology. This would mean to see in detail that, after
taking the localization of the line bundle cohomologies
onto the elements of P (SR) into account, one has only
computed the complete Čech cohomology up to this remnant sequence.
We have tested the conjecture in many situations, with
the most complicated one being line bundles on a CalabiYau fourfold with a resolved SU (5) singularity of a certain divisor. Here the Stanley-Reisner ideal involved
about 20 generators with many coordinates appearing
more than once.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Based on earlier observations in1 and2 , in this letter
we presented a general working algorithm for the computation of line bundle valued cohomology classes over
D-dimensional toric varieties. Evaluating the Čech cohomology for certain comparably simple examples, we
realized that the representatives of the local sections generating H i (X; L) with i = 0, . . . , D are given by certain
rational functions in the homogeneous coordinates, where
the elements of the Stanley-Reisner ideal appeared in the
denominator. The algorithm became more involved by
realizing that for the case that homogeneous coordinates
appeared more than once in the Stanley-Reisner ideal,
extra multiplicities had to appear. For the determination of these extra factors, we proposed to evaluate a
remnant cohomology, which we suspect can be thought
of as the not yet fully resolved part of the original Čech
cohomology, after the localization on the Stanley-Reisner
ideal sets has been done.
We checked many examples and found no deviation
from known results, Serre duality or the Riemann-RochHirzebruch index theorem. The algorithm also is consistent with results obtained by the algorithm presented
recently in13 . Clearly, the advantage of the latter is that
it has been mathematically proven, but we want to emphasize that, in the cases we tested, our algorithm was
much more efficient. Indeed, examples that need about
10 minutes of computing time using the “chamber” algorithm could still be done with pencil and paper using the
algorithm presented here.
Finally, having available such a simple and easy to
implement algorithm paves the way to perform a whole
amount of concrete computations in string theory. This
includes heterotic string compactifications over CalabiYau manifolds as well as intersecting D-brane models and
F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. We
will report on the applications to these string theoretic
cases in a future publication5 .

Added: Proof of the algorithm

About three months after the preprint release of this
work, a proof of the conjectured algorithm was presented
in15 , which also clarifies much of the underlying mathematical structures. At the same time an independant
proof was developed in16 — published in fact a few days
earlier — which utilized alternative methods.

Appendix A: Mathematical Background

This section serves as a reference to the mathematical
notions and structures used later on. We recall the definition of sheaves, which are abundantly used in mathematical physics in the context of vector bundles, and
summarize the basic ideas behind sheaf and Čech cohomology. The language is therefore much more formal
compared to the first part of this paper.
1.

Sheaves

In mathematics one often encounters spaces which are
defined by stitching together local patches in a suitable
fashion. Therefore it seems natural to attach additional
data directly to those patches, i.e. to local subsets of
the described total space. This idea is formalized using
the notion of a sheaf, which can also be treated as a
generalization of the ordinary bundle concept, where the
fiber space attached to every point of the base space may
vary.
Let us recall the formal definition of a sheaf:18 Given
a topological space X, a sheaf F of Abelian groups or
modules on X assigns to each open subset U ⊂ X an
Abelian group or module F (U ), such that
1. Normalization: F (∅) = 1, the trivial group or
module.

8
2. Local uniqueness: If U = {Ui } is an open covering of U ⊂ X and s, t ∈ F (U ) are two elements
(“sections over U ”) that are identical on each local
subset, i.e. s|Ui = t|Ui for all Ui ∈ U, then in fact
s = t follows.
3. Gluing: If U, V ⊂ X are two open sets and
sU ∈ F (U ) as well as sV ∈ F (V ) two elements
(“sections”) that are identical on the intersection,
i.e. sU |U∩V = sV |U∩V , then there exists a glued
element s ∈ F (U ∪ V ) such that s|U = sU and
s|V = sV .
Note that for some subset U ⊂ X the restriction F |U
is itself a sheaf on U , given by F |U (V ) = F (U ∩ V ),
whereas F (U ) refers to the Abelian group or module
attached to the subset.
In order to see that a sheaf generalizes the notion of
π
bundles, let E −։ X be a vector bundle. For U ⊂ X
let Γ(U, E) denote the space of sections over U , which
naturally has a module structure by addition of sections,
i.e. fiberwise addition of the respective vectors, and multiplication with holomorphic functions. If we define F
via F (U ) := Γ(U, E) it can be shown that all the properties of a sheaf are satisfied. Therefore we observe that
the formal transition from bundles to sheaves is essentially nothing else as treating them in terms of the local
sections. In this sense the notation Γ(U, F ) is frequently
used to refer to the elements of F (U ).

Sheaf cohomology

Given a sheaf F on a variety X one can define sheaf cohomology groups H p (X; F ), which are similar to e.g. de
Rham cohomology groups of differential forms with values in a vector bundle. If
d0

d1

d2

0 −→ F ֒−→ I 0 −→ I 1 −→ I 2 −→ . . .

(A1)

is an injective resolution of the sheaf F , denoted by
(I • , d• ), there is an induced complex of global sections
d̃0

d̃1

d̃2

0 −→ I 0 (X) −→ I 1 (X) −→ I 2 (X) −→ . . .

(A2)

satisfying d˜p+1 ◦ d˜p = 0 for all p ≥ 0. Note that
this only implies im(d˜p ) ⊆ ker(d˜p+1 ), whereas for exactness of the sequence the equality must be strictly
satisfied. The first term F (X) of the induced complex I • (X), d˜• is usually omitted for notational convenience and d˜−1 : 0 ֒−→ I 0 (X) is the zero mapping. The
sheaf cohomology groups of F are then defined by

ker(d˜p )
H p (X; F ) := H p I • (X) =
.
im(d˜p−1 )

(A3)

One certainly has to verify a number of mathematical
aspects in order to prove that this is well-defined, see19 .

As one may anticipate from the notion of cohomology, a sheaf homomorphism F −→ G induces a corresponding homomorphism of sheaf cohomology groups
H p (X; F ) −→ H p (X; G ) and a short exact sequence of
sheaves gives rise to a long exact sequence of sheaf cohomology groups. Furthermore, from the definition it
follows that H 0 (X; F ) = F (X) = Γ(X, F ), i.e. the 0th
sheaf cohomology group can be treated as the space of
global sections of the sheaf F over X, which in our cases
usually corresponds to global sections of the vector bundle described by the sheaf.
3.

Čech cohomology

The elegant abstract definition of sheaf cohomology is
unfortunately rather unsuitable for actual computations.
However, there is a another cohomology theory based
on intersections of open sets covering X that yields an
equivalent cohomology, called Čech cohomology.
m
Let UX = {U
Smi }i=1 be an open covering of the variety
X, i.e. X = i=1 Ui and every Ui ⊂ X is an open set.
As usual F (Ui ) refers to the Abelian group or module
that the sheaf F associates to the open set Ui . The Čech
cochains are defined by
M
(A4)
Č p (U; F ) =
F (Ui0 ∩ Ui1 ∩ · · · ∩ Uip ),
0≤i0 <i1 <···<ip ≤m

which means we are considering all the Abelian groups or
modules, the sheaf F associated to mutual intersections
of p + 1 open sets of the covering U. Let α = α(i0 , . . . , ip )
denote an element of F (Ui0 ∩ · · · ∩ Uip ). The exterior
derivative — i.e. mapping of the complex — is then defined by
dˇp : Č p (U; F ) −→ Č p+1 (U; F ) ,

dˇp (α) (i0 , . . . , ip+1 )
=

p+1
X

k=0

where
(A5)

(−1) α(i0 , . . . , ibk , . . . , ip+1 ) Ui ∩···∩Ui
k

0

,

p+1

with the “hatted” index ibk being omitted. Basically,
we are considering the alternating sum with one index
omitted, which is familiar from the exterior derivative of
e.g. the de Rham complex. Again, one can check the
property dˇp+1 ◦ dˇp = 0, such that
ď0

ď1

(A6)
0 −→ Č 0 (U; F ) −→ Č 1 (U; F ) −→ . . .

indeed gives the Čech complex Č • (U; F ), dˇ• . The pth
Čech cohomology group is then defined by

ker(dˇp )
Ȟ p (U; F ) = H p Č • (U; F ) =
,
im(dˇp−1 )

(A7)

which as before measures the failure of the complex to
be exact. Again, one has to prove several mathematical

9
aspects in order to show that any potential ambiguities
are indeed taken care of in this definition. Like for sheaf
cohomology one can show that a sheaf homomorphism
F −→ G induces a mapping of Čech cohomology groups
Ȟ p (U; F ) −→ Ȟ p+1 (U; G ) and a short exact sequence of
sheaves yields a long exact sequence of Čech cohomology
groups. Furthermore, it follows Ȟ 0 (U; F ) = F (X) =
Γ(X; F ) which establishes the equivalence of both sheaf
and Čech cohomology at the 0th level.
Naturally the question arises how the sheaf and Čech
cohomology groups for p > 0 are related. Let U =
n
{Ui }m
i=1 and V = {Vj }j=1 be two open coverings of the
variety X. Then V is called a refinement of U if there
exists an index mapping φ, such that Vj ⊆ Uφ(j) holds
for all j = 1, . . . , n — basically every open set of the covering U may be broken down into several open subsets
which provide the covering V. This establishes a partial
ordering “≤” between different coverings and therefore
allows to use the notion of direct limit. Then it can be
proved that in general
H p (X; F ) ∼
= lim Ȟ p (U; F )
| {z } −→U | {z }

(A8)

H p (X; F ) ∼
= Ȟ p (U; F ).

(A9)

sheaf cohomology

Čech cohomology

holds for all p ≥ 0, which basically implies that for a
sufficiently refined open covering of X both sheaf and
Čech cohomology groups are identical. For the cases relevant to physicists the statement can be substantially improved: Let F be a quasicoherent sheaf and U = {Ui }m
i=1
an affine open covering of the variety X, then for all p ≥ 0
there are natural isomorphisms

Essentially, those statements allow physicists to talk
about sheaf cohomology but carry out all the actual computations using Čech cohomology. The huge advantage
of Čech cohomology lies in the fact that for a suitable
choice of the open covering U the necessary explicit computations of the Čech complex are greatly simplified.

smoothness assumption on X, i.e.
∗
Div(X) ∼
).
= H 0 (X; M∗X /OX

(A10)

Now consider the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles over X. The tensor product of vector
bundles and the dual vector bundle naturally provide it
with an Abelian group structure, which is called the Picard group Pic(X). Again, there is an isomorphism
∗
Pic(X) ∼
)
= H 1 (X; OX

(A11)

relating to sheaf cohomology. Note that one usually ignores the fact that Pic(X) consists of the isomorphism
classes of line bundles instead of the line bundles, which
leads to a frequent abuse in notation. Now there exists
a natural group homomorphism20
Ξ : Div(X) −→ Pic(X)
D 7→ OX (D)

(A12)

that maps some Weil divisor to a corresponding element
of the Picard group, i.e. it maps a divisor to an isomorphism class of holomorphic vector bundles. A corresponding vector bundle of this class can be defined as
follows:
Due to (A10) any divisor corresponds to a global sec∗
tion ρ of M∗X /OX
, which can be specified in terms of
functions ρi ∈ M∗X (Ui ) for some covering U = {Ui }
of X. The line bundle representative corresponding
to OX (D) is then specified by the transition functions
∗
hij := ρi · ρ−1
j ∈ OX (Uij ). It is necessary to show that
∗
the hij indeed define an element of Ȟ 1 (U; OX
), such that
OX (D) is a well-defined Picard generator via (A11) and
(A9). Furthermore, OX (D) satisfies a number of useful
properties:
• Abelian group structure: OX (D + D′ ) = OX (D) ⊗
OX (D′ )
• Inverse elements: OX (−D) ∼
= OX (D)∗

4.

• Neutral element: OX (0) ∼
= OX

Holomorphic line bundles and divisors

The primary sheaf of interest in subsequent dealings
is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on X, denoted by
OX . For each open set U ⊂ X the corresponding module OX (U ) is the set of holomorphic functions U −→ C.
In fact, OX has a natural (commutative) ring structure
induced by complex multiplication. In this context OX
is called the structure sheaf of X and turns it into a
∗
ringed space. Furthermore, there are the sheaves OX
of nowhere zero holomorphic functions, MX of meromorphic functions and M∗X of non-trivial meromorphic
functions, which are frequently used in algebraic geometry.
Those sheaves are naturally related to divisors, which
are formal sums of irreducible hypersurfaces of X. The
set of such Weil divisors is denoted Div(X) and it is in

• Naturality: OX (f ∗ D) ∼
= f ∗ OY (D) for a holomorphic mapping f : X −→ Y .

Index theorems

Due to the numerous sequences and steps one has to
work through in order to derive the information of interest, it is useful to have a couple of non-trivial consistency
checks at hand. Those are provided by index theorems,
which allow to compute certain topological invariants via
entirely different means. The Euler characteristic

10
can be defined as either the alternating sum of the Betti
numbers bi (X) := dimR H i (X), or as the integral of a
differential form representing the Euler class e(X), which
is equal to the top Chern class cn (X) ∈ H 2n (X) for some
complex n-dimensional manifold.
For the Kähler manifolds that are primarily investigated via toric geometry, the prior statement can be generalized to a holomorphic version. Basically, the Euler
class e(X) is replaced by the Todd class Td(X), which is
defined only for complex vector bundles. The Todd class
can be expanded in terms of Chern classes like
c1
2c2 + 2c2 + c1 c2

which usually allows for a rather simple computation of
this quantity. For holomorphic (0, p)-forms the relation
(A13) generalizes to an alternating sum of certain Hodge
