ABSTRACT
By looking at phase transitions which occur as parameters are varied in supersymmetric gauge theories, a natural relation is found between sigma models based
on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces and Landau-Ginzburg
models. The construction permits one to recover the known correspondence between these types of models and to greatly extend it to include new classes of
manifolds and also to include models with (0, 2) world-sheet supersymmetry. The
construction also predicts the possibility of certain physical processes involving a
change in the topology of space-time.

1. INTRODUCTION
The present paper is based on systematically exploiting one simple idea which
is familiar in N = 1 supersymmetric theories in four dimensions and which we will
therefore first state in that context. We consider renormalizable gauge theories
constructed from vector (gauge) multiplets and charged chiral multiplets. If the
gauge group includes a U(1) factor, one of the possible supersymmetric interactions
is the Fayet-Iliopoulos D term. In terms of a vector superfield V , this term can be
written as

where e is the gauge coupling, W is a holomorphic function known as the superpotential, and
D = −e2 (

(1.3)

Actually, D can be interpreted as the Hamiltonian function for the U(1) action
on a copy of Ck (on which the si are coordinates and which we endow with the
P
Kahler form ω = −i j dsj ∧ ds̄j ). The parameter r corresponds to the familiar
possibility of adding a constant to the Hamiltonian.

As r is varied, such a system will typically undergo phase transitions, in many
cases leaving supersymmetry unbroken but otherwise changing the pattern of massless fields. This is a familiar and important story in phenomenology of renormalizable supersymmetric theories in four dimensions. Our intention in the present
paper is to study the same models, but dimensionally reduced to D = 2. The
two dimensional version of the story is particularly rich, because milder anomaly
2

cancellation conditions give more freedom in constructing models and because of
the usual special properties of massless fields in two dimensions.
As a special case which originally motivated this investigation, we will recover
the familiar correspondence between Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg models
[1,2,3]. The usual arguments for this correspondence are heuristic arguments of universality [1–3] including the simple fact that the Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg
models are N = 2 models parametrized by the same data, a heuristic path integral
argument [3], and equivalence of the cc chiral rings, which is discussed in the papers just cited and in [4-6]. From our construction we will recapture essentially all
the concrete evidence for the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence along
with new features. The argument will be carried out without assuming or proving
conformal invariance of either Calabi-Yau or Landau-Ginzburg models; the picture
is certainly richer when supplemented by (well-known) independent arguments for
conformal invariance.
We will also find many generalizations of the usual C-Y/L-G correspondence,
involving more general classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds (hypersurfaces in products
of projective spaces and in more general toric and other varieties, and intersections of such hypersurfaces). One novelty is that in general one must consider
gauged Landau-Ginzburg models as well as ordinary ones. Moreover, we will get
an extension of the C-Y/L-G correspondence to models with (0, 2) world-sheet
supersymmetry. Hitherto only the case of (2, 2) supersymmetry has been considered. (0, 2) world-sheet supersymmetry is of phenomenological interest as it can
naturally lead, for instance, to models with space-time grand unified gauge group
SU(5) or SO(10) rather than E6 .
Variation of the coefficients of the Fayet-Iliopoulos D terms can also induce
phase transitions involving changes in the topology of a Calabi-Yau manifold. This
will be investigated from a local point of view only in §5.5. For reasons explained

in §4, the topology changes in question preserve the birational equivalence class

of the Calabi-Yau manifold. Precisely this situation has been studied globally by
3

Aspinwall, Greene, and Morrison [7] who by using mirror symmetry (and finding
pairs of topologically different but birationally equivalent manifolds with the same
mirror) obtained very precise and detailed evidence for the possibility of physical
processes with change of topology. The present problem turned out to have an
unexpectedly close relation to their investigation, and I benefited from discussions
with them, especially in §5.5. The results of [7] and of §5.5 are the first concrete
evidence for the (long-suspected) occurrence in string theory of processes with
change of the space-time topology.
The present paper is based on familiar representations of the relevant sigma
models [8], except that we will consider linear sigma models (rather than the nonlinear ones to which they reduce at low energies); this gives a useful added freedom
of maneuver.
While this work was in progress, I received a paper by Thaddeus [9] who
uses a mathematical idea closely related to that of the present paper to prove the
Verlinde formula for the dimension of the space of conformal blocks of the SU(2)
WZW model.

2. FIELD THEORY BACKGROUND
In this section, I will present the field theory background to our subsequent
analysis. Most of the detailed formulas of this section are not needed for reading
the paper, and are presented for reference and to be more self-contained.
N = 2 supersymmetry in two dimensions can be obtained by dimensional
reduction from N = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensional space-time. A number
of good books exist [10–14]. Our conventions for four dimensional superfields will
be those of [10].

dotted indices. The tensors σαmα̇ are in the representation used in [10]

labeled by a capital letter Φ, S, P, . . . will be denoted by the corresponding lower
case letter φ, s, p, . . ..
To formulate gauge theory, one introduces a gauge field in superspace, replacing
the differential operators Dα , D α̇ , and ∂m = ∂/∂xm by gauge covariant derivatives

Dα , D α̇ , and Dm . One imposes however a severe restriction on the superspace gauge
fields. To permit charged chiral superfields to exist, one needs the integrability of
the equation D α̇ Φ = 0. So one requires
0 = {Dα̇ , Dβ̇ } = {Dα , Dβ }.

(2.6)

These conditions ensure that, with a suitable partial gauge fixing,
Dα = e−V Dα eV
D α̇ = eV Dα̇ e−V ,

(2.7)

where V is a real Lie algebra valued function on superspace; V is known as a vector
superfield. One also imposes the further constraint
{Dα , Dα̇ } = −2iσαmα̇ Dm ,

(2.8)

so that the superspace gauge field is entirely determined in terms of V .
There is still a residual gauge invariance, which for gauge group U(1) – in
which case V is simply a single real function on superspace – takes the form
V → V + i(Λ − Λ),

(2.9)

Λ being a chiral superfield. A chiral superfield Φ of charge Q transforms under
6

this residual gauge invariance as
Φ → exp(−iQΛ) · Φ.

(2.10)

One can partially fix this residual gauge invariance (by going to what is called
Wess-Zumino gauge) to put V in the form

α̇
α̇
α̇
α̇
V = −θα σαmα̇ θ vm + iθα θα θα̇ λ − iθα̇ θ θα λα + θα θα θα̇ θ D.

(2.11)

In Wess-Zumino gauge, one still retains the ordinary gauge invariance. This corresponds to Λ = −a(x) (a real function of x only) with the usual transformation

laws Φ → exp(iQa)Φ, v → v − da.

In four dimensions, the basic gauge invariant field strength of the abelian gauge
field is [Dα , Dm ]. In two dimensions there is a more basic invariant that we will

introduce later.

In Wess-Zumino gauge, though the physical content of the theory is relatively
transparent, the supersymmetry transformation laws are relatively complicated
because supersymmetry transformations (generated by Qα and Qα̇ ) must be accompanied by gauge transformations to preserve the Wess-Zumino gauge. The
transformation laws become still more complicated when dimensionally reduced
⋆

to two dimensions.

I will now write down the reduced transformation laws, in

Wess-Zumino gauge, for reference, but I hasten to reassure the reader that this
paper can be read without detailed familiarity with the following formulas.
In making the reduction, I will take the fields to be independent of x1 and x2 .
Thus, the components v1 and v2 of the gauge field in the x1 and x2 directions, along
⋆ All conventions will be those that follow by dimensional reduction from four dimensional
conventions of [10]. I adopted this approach because the models we will study arise so
naturally by reduction from four dimensions. Also, there do not seem to be any standard
conventions for component expansions of vector superfields in two dimensions. Chiral superfields in two dimensions
are often described by conventions that differ from the present
√
ones by factors of 2; these factors can be absorbed in rescaling the fields in a fairly obvious
way.

with all the other fields, are functions of x0 , x3 only; I write σ = (v1 − iv2 )/ 2,
√
σ = (v1 + iv2 )/ 2. For the remaining space-time coordinates, I will adopt a
two dimensional notation, writing x0 = y 0 , x3 = y 1 . After dimensional reduction, it is convenient to label the fermion components as (ψ 1 , ψ 2 ) = (ψ − , ψ + ) and
(ψ1 , ψ2 ) = (ψ− , ψ+ ) (so ψ − = ψ+ , ψ + = −ψ− ), and similarly for dotted components. The dimensionally reduced transformation laws of the vector multiplet
under a supersymmetry transformation with parameters ǫ± , ǫ± are (by reducing
the formulas on p. 50 of [10])

δvm = iǫσm λ + iǫσm λ
√
√
δσ = −i 2ǫ+ λ− − i 2ǫ− λ+

δσ = −i 2ǫ+ λ− − i 2ǫ− λ+

√
δλ+ = iǫ+ D + 2(∂0 + ∂1 )σǫ− − v01 ǫ+
√
δλ− = iǫ− D + 2(∂0 − ∂1 )σǫ+ + v01 ǫ−
√
δλ+ = −iǫ+ D + 2(∂0 + ∂1 )σǫ− − v01 ǫ+
√
δλ− = −iǫ− D + 2(∂0 − ∂1 )σ ǫ+ + v01 ǫ− ,
(2.12)
with v01 = ∂0 v1 − ∂1 v0 .
In the presence of gauge fields, a chiral superfield Φ in a given representation
of the gauge group is a superfield obeying Dα̇ Φ = 0, where the covariant derivative
in Dα̇ is taken in the appropriate representation. If we write

Φ = eV Φ0 ,

(2.13)

then Φ0 obeys D α̇ Φ0 = 0 and has a theta expansion of the form given in (2.4).

The transformation laws for these component fields come out to be

δψ+ = i 2(D0 + D1 )φǫ− + 2ǫ+ F − 2Qφσ ǫ+

The transformation laws of the antichiral multiplet Φ are the complex conjugate
of these.
Twisted Chiral Superfields; Gauge Field Strength
One of the novelties that appears in two dimensions, relative to four, is that
in addition to chiral superfields, obeying D + Φ = D − Φ = 0, it is possible to
have twisted chiral superfields, obeying D+ Σ = D− Σ = 0 [15–19]. Sigma models
containing both chiral and twisted chiral superfields are quite lovely. Since mirror
symmetry turns chiral multiplets into twisted chiral multiplets, it is likely that
consideration of appropriate models containing multiplets of both types is helpful
for understanding mirror symmetry.
More important for our present purposes, however, is the fact (exploited in [20]
in explaining N = 2 duality as an abelian mirror symmetry) that in two dimensions
the basic gauge invariant field strength of the superspace gauge field is a twisted
chiral superfield. This quantity is

Σ = √ {D + , D− }.

which according to the Bianchi identities is annihilated by D+ and D− . In the
abelian case, one has

(The complicated terms involving derivatives are determined from the first three
terms by the twisted chiral condition D+ Σ = D− Σ = 0; they could be eliminated

by the twisted version of xm → y m + iθα σαmα̇ θα̇ .)
Lagrangians

It is straightforward to write Lagrangians in superspace. We will consider only
super-renormalizable theories that will be particularly simple representatives of
their universality classes.
These Lagrangians are of the form

L = Lkin + LW + Lgauge + LD,θ

(2.17)

where the four terms are respectively the kinetic energy of chiral superfields, the superpotential interaction, the kinetic energy of gauge fields, and the Fayet-Iliopoulos
term and theta angle, all constructed as follows.
For simplicity, we write the formulas for the case of an abelian gauge group
U(1)s , described as above by vector superfields Va , a = 1 . . . s. This will be the case
of primary interest. We assume that there are k chiral superfields Φi of charges
Qi,a . The Φi can be interpreted as coordinates on a copy of Z = Ck ; and their
kinetic energy is determined by a Kahler metric on Z. For superrenormalizability,
this metric should be flat. The Lagrangian corresponding to such a metric is, with
a suitable choice of coordinates,

The other part of the Lagrangian involving the chiral superfields is constructed

Lagrangian is

simply by summing over the various components, as in (2.23).

Because ln σ is only well-defined modulo 2πiZ, (2.31) is not well-defined as a realvalued functional. However, in quantum mechanics it is good enough if ∆L is

well-defined modulo 2π. Since d2 y v01 takes values in 2πZ, ∆L is well-defined

modulo 2π if and only if

4πp ∈ Z.

(2.32)

Because (2.31) has a singularity at σ = 0, its possible generation by quantum
corrections would occur, if at all, only in an approximation whose validity would
13

be limited to large σ. This is precisely what we will find. For future use, let us note
that if σ is large and slowly varying, then the addition of (2.31) to the Lagrangian
would have the effect of shifting r to an effective value
ref f = r + 2p ln |σ|.

(2.33)

Symmetries
The models that we have constructed have N = 2 supersymmetry in two
dimensions, that is two left-moving supersymmetries (acting on θ− , θ− ) and two
right-moving ones (acting on θ+ , θ+ ). It is natural to ask if the models also have left
and right-moving R symmetries. A right-moving R symmetry is a U(1) symmetry
under which θ+ → eiα θ+ , θ+ → e−iα θ+ , while θ− , θ− are invariant. A left-moving

R symmetry obeys the analogous condition with + and − exchanged.

Left and right-moving R symmetries are important because they are part of
the N = 2 superconformal algebra. If present, they give important information
about possible conformally invariant limits of the models under discussion.
The existence of such left and right-moving symmetries in the models under
discussion is fairly natural from the four dimensional point of view. Many four dimensional supersymmetric theories would have a single R symmetry, with charges
±

+1 for θ+ and θ− , and −1 for θ . In addition, in the process of dimensional

reduction to two dimensions, we potentially get a second U(1) symmetry – cor-

responding to rotations of the extra dimensions. Under this symmetry, θ+ and
θ− transform oppositely. By taking suitable combinations of these operations, one
may hope to find the left or right-moving R symmetry, under which θ+ or θ−
should be invariant.
It is easy to find these symmetries explicitly in the above two dimensional
formulas. First we suppress the superpotential interaction LW , and we also assume
that any twisted superpotential interaction, if present, is a linear term of the specific
form LD,θ . Under these assumptions, the left and right-moving R symmetries are
14

easy to find explicitly. For instance, there is a right-moving R symmetry (ǫ+ = −ǫ−

has charge 1, ǫ− = ǫ+ is invariant) under which the non-zero charge assignments are
as follows: (ψ+i , Fi , σa , λ−a ) have charges (−1, −1, 1, 1); their complex conjugates
have opposite charge; and other fields are invariant. A left-moving R symmetry

(ǫ− = ǫ+ has charge 1, ǫ+ = −ǫ− is invariant) likewise can be constructed under

which (ψ−i , Fi , σa , λ+a ) have charges (−1, −1, −1, 1) and other fields are neutral.

Let us call the charges generating the right- and left-moving symmetries JR and
JL .
One of the most important properties is that JR and JL may be anomalous. The reason for this is that JR , for instance, couples to right-moving charged
fermions ψ+i , ψ+i , but the left-moving fermions that it couples to are neutral. The

condition that there should be no gauge anomalies that would spoil conservation
of JR is that
X

Qi,a = 0,

for a = 1 . . . s.

(2.34)

i

The same condition is needed to ensure that JL is actually a valid symmetry. (In
any event, regardless of the Qi,a , the sum JL + JR is conserved.) We will see later
that various other good things happen when (2.34) is imposed.
Before going on, it is important to note that the models under discussion, if
we ignore the superpotential, have additional (non-anomalous) symmetries that
commute with both left and right-moving supersymmetries and therefore could be
added to the JL and JR introduced above. These are global transformations of the
chiral superfields of the form
Φi → exp(iαki )Φi ,

(2.35)

with arbitrary ki ; they commute with supersymmetry since a common transformation is assumed for each component of Φi .
Are these R symmetries still valid in the presence of a superpotential? The
R
couplings coming from d2 θ W have charge 1 under JR as we have defined it
15

hitherto. To save the situation, we must add to JR a transformation of the form
(2.35) under which W → e−iα W . The superpotential W is said to be quasi-

homogeneous if ki exist so that W transforms as indicated. Thus, by adding

additional terms to the original JR (and analogous additional terms for JL ), one
can find left- and right-moving R symmetries precisely in case (2.34) holds and W
is quasi-homogeneous.
The twisted superpotential violates R-invariance unless it takes the linear form
that leads to what we have called LD,θ . Therefore, in the R-invariant case, the
quantum corrections cannot generate a more complicated twisted chiral superpotential.

3. THE C-Y/L-G CORRESPONDENCE
We now turn to our problem of shedding some light on the correspondence
between Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg models. In doing so, we will consider
only the simplest situation, with a gauge group that is simply G = U(1), and thus
a single vector superfield V . The generalizations will be relegated to §4.
Happily, of all the formulas of §2, we primarily need only a few of the simpler

ones. The fields D and Fi enter in the Lagrangian (2.17) as “auxiliary fields,”
without kinetic energy. One can solve for them by their equations of motion to get

3.1. The Model
Now, let me explain the situation on which we will focus. We take the chiral
superfields Φi to be n fields Si of charge 1, and one field P of charge −n. This obviously ensures condition (2.34) for anomaly cancellation and R invariance. Lower

case letters si and p will denote the bosonic fields in the supermultiplets Si and P .
We take the superpotential to be the gauge invariant function
W = P · G(S1 , . . . , Sn ),

(3.3)

with G a homogeneous polynomial of degree n. Notice that this W is quasihomogeneous; one can pick the ki in (2.35) to be −1 for P and 0 for Si or (by adding

a multiple of the gauge generator) 0 for P and −1/n for Si . The superpotentials we

consider later in this paper will always be quasi-homogeneous in a similar obvious
way; this will not be spelled out in detail in subsequent examples.
We want to choose G to be “transverse” in the sense that the equations
0=

∂G
∂G
= ... =
∂S1
∂Sn

(3.4)

have no common root except at Si = 0. This property ensures that if we think
of the Si as homogeneous variables, then the hypersurface X in CPn−1 defined
by the equation G = 0 is smooth. A generic homogeneous polynomial has this
property. An analogous transversality condition enters in each of our later models.
For the model just introduced, the bosonic potential (3.2) is

(3.6)

Now, let us discuss the low energy physics for various values of r. First, we
take r >> 0. In this case, obtaining D = 0 requires that the si cannot all vanish.
17

That being so, vanishing of the term |p|2

P

i |∂i G|

2 in the potential requires (in

view of transversality of G) that p = 0. Vanishing of D therefore gives us precisely
X

si si = r.

(3.7)

i

Dividing the space of solutions of (3.7) by the gauge group U(1), we get precisely
a copy of complex projective space CPn−1 , with Kahler class proportional to r.
Finally, we must set G = 0 to ensure the vanishing of the first term in the formula
(3.5) for the potential, and σ = 0 to ensure the vanishing of the last term.
So the space of classical vacua is isomorphic to the hypersurface X ⊂ CPn−1

defined by G = 0. It is a well-known fact that a smooth hypersurface of degree k
in CPn−1 is a Calabi-Yau manifold if and only if k = n. We have not accidentally
stumbled upon the Calabi-Yau condition. We picked P to be of charge −n, and

hence G of degree n, to ensure the condition (2.34) for anomaly-free R-invariance.

Anomaly free R-invariance of the underlying model ensures such invariance of the
effective low energy sigma model; but for sigma models, anomaly free R-invariance
is equivalent to the Calabi-Yau condition.
All modes other than oscillations tangent to X have masses at tree level. (The
gauge field v gets a mass from the Higgs mechanism; masses for p, σ, and modes
of si not tangent to X are visible in (3.4).) The low energy theory therefore is a
sigma model with target space X and Kahler class proportional to r.
Now we consider the case of r << 0. In this case, the vanishing of D requires
P
p =
6 0. The vanishing of |p|2 i |∂i G|2 then requires (given transversality of G)
p
that all si = 0. This being so, the modulus of p must in fact be |p| = −r/n. By
a gauge transformation, one can fix the argument of p to vanish. So the theory has
a unique classical vacuum, up to gauge transformation. In expanding around this
vacuum, the si are massless (for n ≥ 3). These massless fields are governed by an

effective superpotential that can be determined by integrating out the massive field

p; integrating out p simply means in this case setting p to its expectation value.
18

√
f = −r · W (si ).
So the effective superpotential of the low energy theory is W
√
The factor of −r is inessential, as it can be absorbed in rescaling the si . This

effective superpotential has (for n ≥ 3 ) a degenerate critical point at the origin,

where it vanishes up to nth order. A theory with a unique classical vacuum state

governed by a superpotential with a degenerate critical point is usually called a
Landau-Ginzburg theory.
In this case, we actually get a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold, that is an orbifold
of a Landau-Ginzburg theory, for the following reason. The vacuum expectation
value of p does not completely destroy the gauge invariance; rather, it breaks U(1)
down to a Zn subgroup E that acts by si → ζsi , where ζ is an nth root of 1.

This residual gauge invariance means that what we get is actually a Zn orbifold
of a Landau-Ginzburg theory. This follows from a general and elementary though
perhaps not universally recognized fact; orbifolds (as the term is usually used in
quantum field theory) are equivalent to theories with a finite gauge group.
In fact, in calculating the path integral on a Riemann surface Σ, instead of
√
expanding about the absolute minimum of the action at p = −r, si = v = 0,

and gauge transformations thereof, we can expand around configurations that are
√
gauge equivalent to p = −r, si = v = 0 only locally. In such configurations, the

gauge fields v may have monodromies. As the monodromies must leave p invariant,

they take values in the group E of nth roots of unity. The construction of the low
energy approximation to the path integral involves a sum over the possible E-valued
monodromies. But this sum over monodromies is precisely the usual operation of
summing over E-twists in all channels by which one constructs the quantum field
theory of the E-orbifold. Thus, in general, orbifolds can be regarded as a special
case of gauge theories in which the gauge group is a finite group.
Of course, both for r >> 0 and for r << 0, the integration over the massive
fields to get an effective theory for the massless fields cannot just be done classically;
we must consider quantum corrections to the sigma model or Landau-Ginzburg
orbifold obtained above. We will look at this more closely in §3.2; suffice it to say
19

here that in the R-invariant case, for sufficiently big |r|, integrating out the massive

fields just corrects the parameters in the effective low energy theory without a
qualitative change in the nature of the system.
The Moral Of The Story
The above construction suggests that, rather than Landau-Ginzburg being

“equivalent” to Calabi-Yau, they are two different phases of the same system. In
fact, from this point of view Landau-Ginzburg looks like the analytic continuation
of Calabi-Yau to negative Kahler class. We will reexamine the moral of our story
after some further analysis.
3.2. The “Singularity”
To extract any precise conclusions about the relation between the LandauGinzburg and Calabi-Yau models, we will have to deal with the apparent singularity
at r = 0 that separates them.
The problem is not that there might be a phase transition at r = 0. In our
applications, we are interested either in quantizing the theory on a circle (compact,
finite volume), or on performing path integrals on a compact Riemann surface.
Either way, we will not see the usual singularities associated with phase transitions;
those depend crucially on having infinite world-sheet volume. The only singularities
we might see would be due to failure of effective compactness of the target space.
For instance, if the σ field were absent (we will see in §6 that it can be sup-

pressed preserving (0, 2) supersymmetry), there could be no singularity at r = 0
in finite world-sheet volume. For without the σ field, the only possible zero of the
classical bosonic potential at r = 0 would be at si = p = 0. Moreover, the locus
in which the classical potential is less than any given number T would likewise
be compact. These conditions mean that in quantization on a circle, quantum
states of any given energy decay exponentially at large values of the fields, so that
the spectrum is discrete. Such a discrete spectrum varies continuously – though
perhaps in a difficult-to-calculate fashion – with the parameters.
20

The σ field changes the picture even for r 6= 0. Though the space of classical

vacua is compact for any r, and was determined above, the space on which the
classical potential is less than some value T is compact only for T small enough. In
fact, for si = p = 0, the classical potential has the constant value D 2 /2e2 = e2 r 2 /2,
independent of σ. This means that only the low-lying part of the spectrum – at
energies such that the region at infinity is inaccessible – is discrete. If the theory
is quantized on a circle of radius R, then at energies above some critical T , the
theory has a continuous spectrum, coming from wave-functions supported near
si = p = 0, |σ| >> 0. Semi-classically, the critical value of T appears to be
Tcr =

e2 r 2
· 2πR.
2

(3.8)

Before going on, let us assess the reliability of this estimate. The non-zero
value of T came from the expectation value of the D field in the region si , p near
zero, |σ| >> 0. In that region, the chiral superfields, including si , p and their

superpartners, have masses proportional to |σ|; the gauge multiplet (σ, v, and λ)

is massless. If one simply sets si and p to zero, the gauge multiplet is described

by a free field theory and (except for a subtlety about the θ angle that we come to
later) there are no quantum corrections at all to the classical value (3.8). Naively,
integrating out fields with masses proportional to |σ| will give only corrections
proportional to negative powers of |σ| and should not change that conclusion.
This will be so if the ultraviolet behavior is good enough.

To see what really happens, consider a general model with chiral superfields

If (3.10) is not obeyed, then (3.9) diverges. To renormalize the theory, we subtract
the value of δD at, say, |σ| = µ. The subtraction is interpreted as a redefinition of

the parameter r. After the subtraction, one has for the large σ behavior

This formula diverges for |σ| → ∞. (The formula also diverges for σ near 0, but this

effect is misleading; for σ near 0, the point si = p = 0 about which we expanded is
unstable and the approximations have been inappropriate.) The divergence means
P
that quantum corrections are large in this region of field space if i Qi 6= 0, and

crucial properties cannot be read off from the classical Lagrangian. The correction
to D can be interpreted in terms of a σ-dependent effective value of r,

(3.12)

One may wonder what superspace interaction can have this σ dependent effective value of r as one of its consequences. Looking back to equation (2.33), the
answer is clear. We have generated a twisted chiral superpotential, of precisely the
form considered in (2.31), with
4πp =

X

Qi

(3.13)

i

– in agreement with our general observation that 4πp must be an integer. (In the
case of the CPn−1 model, to which we will specialize later, this effect was first
22

computed from a different viewpoint by D’Adda et. al. [21]. The general formula
has also been conjectured [22].) I leave it to the curious reader to verify, by further
computations in the large σ region, the σ-dependent effective value of θ that is also
predicted by this twisted chiral superpotential.
Before discussing the consequences of this computation, let us assess its relevance. Is the specific quantum correction that we just evaluated the only one that
matters? In fact, for large σ, this theory is a theory of massless free fields weakly
coupled by superrenormalizable interactions to fields of mass proportional to σ.
Perturbation theory will be uniformly valid (and in fact increasingly good) for
large σ, unless there are ultraviolet divergences. (Such divergences can be translated upon renormalization into effects that grow for large σ, as we have just seen.)
Because of the superrenormalizability of these models, and the non-renormalization
theorems of the superpotential, the only divergent quantum correction is the oneloop renormalization of r that we have just encountered. (A roughly analogous
fact in four dimensional renormalizable supersymmetric theories is that the only
quadratic divergence is the one loop renormalization of r, again proportional to
P
i Qi .) That is why this is the important quantum correction.

The Case

P

i Qi = 0

Let us now discuss the consequences of the above computation. First we assume
P
that i Qi = 0. In that case, for large σ we can simply throw away the chiral
superfields, with their masses of order |σ|. We still have to look at the effective

theory of the massless gauge multiplet; this multiplet has the effective Lagrangian
Lgauge + LD,θ . This effective theory is a free theory, and supersymmetry ensures
that the usual quantum corrections to the ground state energy from zero point
fluctuations in σ and λ cancel. But for the gauge field v, an important subtlety
arises. The Lagrangian for v is

Σ

The significance of the θ term in abelian gauge theory in two dimensions was
23

explained long ago [23]. It induces a constant electric field in the vacuum, equal
to the electric field due to a charge of strength θ/2π. This constant electric field
contributes to the energy of the vacuum. This contribution has the value that
one might guess by simply minimizing the Lagrangian with respect to v01 , namely
(e2 /2) · (θ/2π)2 . More exactly, this is so as long as |θ| ≤ π. Otherwise, by a

process involving pair creation, the contribution to the energy can be reduced to
the minimum value of (e2 /2) · ((θ/2π) − n)2 for n ∈ Z. The contribution of the
theta term to the vacuum energy density is thus in general

e ≤ π and θe − θ ∈ 2πZ. In particular the vacuum energy density is a

We thus can determine the exact, quantum-corrected analog of (3.8): the minimum energy density of a quantum state at large σ is

The minimum energy of a quantum state obtained in quantizing the gauge multiplet

(3.17)

The quantum energy spectrum is discrete and continuously varying for energies
′ , for at such energies the target space is effectively compact, the region
below Tcr
′ is non-zero,
of large σ being inaccessible. As long as either r or θ is non-zero, Tcr

and there is a range of energies with such a discrete spectrum.
Another statement along a similar lines is important in some of our applications. Instead of considering the energy H, one could consider H + P , P being
24

the momentum. Since the vacuum has P = 0 and particle excitations contribute a
non-negative amount to H +P , the conclusion is the same: the spectrum is discrete
′ .
for H + P < Tcr

In all of our applications, when we try to actually learn something from the
relation between Landau-Ginzburg and Calabi-Yau models, we will use some sort
of generalized topological reasoning. In the simplest case, we consider the index of
one of the supercharges (equal to Tr(−1)F or the elliptic genus, as explained below).
Given a discrete and continuously varying spectrum for H (or H + P ) below some
positive constant, these indices can be computed by counting the states of H = 0
(or H +P = 0), and in particular are well-defined and invariant under deformation.
Therefore, these quantities are independent of r and θ except at r = θ = 0, and
we can interpolate safely from r > 0 to r < 0 by taking θ 6= 0.
We will also consider more delicate quantities involving couplings of states of
H = 0 (or H + P = 0). Some of these quantities, related to Yukawa couplings,
for instance, are predicted to be independent of r, θ, while others are predicted
to vary holomorphically in t. These predictions depend on arguments (see [24],
for instance) that rest ultimately on integration by parts in field space. These
arguments might fail if the integrand of the path integral were to behave badly
′ 6= 0, wave functionals of states of H = 0
for σ → ∞. However, as long as Tcr

(or H + P = 0) vanish exponentially for σ → ∞. Path integral representations

of couplings of such states are then highly convergent, and integration by parts in
field space is justified.
In sum, then, the only real singularity, for the topological quantitities in finite

volume, is at r = θ = 0. By taking θ 6= 0, we can continue happily from Calabi-Yau
to Landau-Ginzburg.

an ordinary W leads to a bosonic potential i |∂i W |2 , a twisted superpotential

This is almost true, except for a factor that comes from the normalization we used

from the effects of the θ angle.

The formula (3.18) is still valid, for the same reasons (except for the same
modifications), for computing the potential energy induced by the more general

that incorporates the quantum correction. After all, for large σ we simply have a

compute the dependence of the energy on r and θ just as we did when these were
strictly constant. So the effective potential for σ is just

that the model has no singularity at any r or θ, as long as i Qi 6= 0. Thus, a

generalization of the sigma model/L.G. correspondence, taking account the extra

For illustration, let us see how the new states enter in the CPn−1 model. We

consider a model with gauge group U(1) and n chiral superfields Si , all of charge 1.

in §3.3, the instanton sums are always finite when i Qi 6= 0 because the anomalous R
symmetry ensures that any given amplitude
P receives contributions only from finitely many
values of the instanton numbers. When i Qi = 0, the instanton sums are infinite sums
that can have singularities; we will see an example in §5.5.
27

For r << 0, it appears on the other hand that supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken. This poses a problem. For r >> 0, the supersymmetric index Tr(−1)F of
†

the theory is equal to n (the Euler characteristic of CPn−1 ), while spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking would mean that the index would be 0 for r << 0. Given
the | ln σ|2 behavior of the potential at infinity, vacuum states cannot flow to or
from infinity, and the index should be constant. To solve the problem, we need
P
only note that i Qi = n. So the expected n zero energy states are found by
setting si = 0 and σ to a solution of (3.21).

Another continuation of the CPn−1 sigma model to negative r was discussed
recently [25].
The Moral, Revisited
Our arguments have been sensitive only to singularities crude enough as to be
visible even in finite world-sheet volume. What is the phase structure in infinite
world-sheet volume? Are Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg separated by a true
phase transition, at or near r = 0?
There is no reason that the answer to this question has to be “universal,”
that is, independent of the path one follows in interpolating from Calabi-Yau to
Landau-Ginzburg in a multiparameter space of not necessarily conformally invariant theories. Along a suitable path, there may well be a sharply defined phase
transition, while along another path there might not be one. This seems quite
plausible.
The situation would then be similar to the relation between the gas and liquid
“phases” of a fluid. We would have one system which in one limit is well described
as Calabi-Yau; in another limit it is well described as Landau-Ginzburg. But these
would be two different limits of the same system, with no order parameter or
inescapable singularity separating them; and so one might say (as is customary)
that Landau-Ginzburg and Calabi-Yau are “equivalent.”
† Its definition is well-known and is given below.
28

It is believed that the theories we are studying all flow in the infrared to
conformal field theories. If so, a particularly interesting type of interpolation from
Landau-Ginzburg to Calabi-Yau would be via conformally invariant theories. Is
there a continuous family of conformal field theories interpolating from LandauGinzburg to Calabi-Yau? This is the only way that Landau-Ginzburg and CalabiYau could truly be “equivalent” as conformal field theories. In the case of topology
change (which we will see to be analogous in §5.5), mirror symmetry gives [7] a
direct indication that the answer is “Yes.” In the present context, we can attempt

to argue (not rigorously) as follows. First of all, any singularity or discontinuity of
a family of conformal field theories that holds on the real line must already hold
on the circle, since conformally the real line is just the circle with a point deleted.
Now, in the above, for linear sigma models we identified all of the singularities
that occur in finite volume: the only such singularity is at r = θ = 0. The key
point to avoid a singularity was the non-vanishing of the large σ minimum energy
density U, given in (3.16). This was an exact formula, not depending on small e.
To approach the infrared limit, we should scale e → inf inity, and it would appear

that U only grows in this limit, so that new singularities would not arise. This

argument encourages me to believe that the singularities we found for linear sigma
models in finite volume are the only ones that will appear in conformal field theory.
The potential trouble with the argument is that the definition of U involved a large
σ limit which might not commute with the large e limit.
In any event, semi-classically, just like liquid and gas, Calabi-Yau and LandauGinzburg look like different “phases,” and I will use that convenient, informal
language.
3.3. Applications
Whether r is positive or negative, the linear sigma models investigated here
are super-renormalizable rather than conformally invariant. Even classically, to
reduce the r >> 0 theory to a Calabi-Yau nonlinear sigma model, or to reduce the
29

r << 0 theory to a Landau-Ginzburg model, we have to take the limit in which e
(the gauge coupling) goes to infinity.
But our arguments depended on having e < ∞. Moreover, e << 1 is really the

region in which the model is under effective control, the semi-classical arguments
being reliable.
If we do take e → ∞ with r >> 0, we will get a Calabi-Yau non-linear sigma

model with target a hypersurface X. The Kahler metric g on X (along with the
corresponding Kahler form ω) is induced from the embedding in CPn−1 (with its

standard metric). It is known that this metric on X does not give a conformally
invariant model. It is believed that there is (for large enough r) a unique Kahler
metric g ′ on X, with a Kahler form ω ′ cohomologous to ω, that gives a conformally
invariant sigma model. The two models with metric g and g ′ differ by a superspace
interaction of the form

Z

d2 xd4 θ T,

(3.24)

where the function T obeys ω − ω ′ = −i∂∂T .
Consequently, even if we set e = ∞, the linear sigma model considered here

is not expected to coincide with the conformally invariant nonlinear sigma model.

They differ by the term (3.24), and moreover the function T is unknown. So how
can we learn anything relevant to the conformally invariant model?
One answer is that the T coupling, like the effects of finite e, are believed to
be “irrelevant” in the technical sense of the renormalization group; that is, these
effects are expected to disappear in the infrared. This is of theoretical importance
– for instance it enters in heuristic discussions of the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau
correspondence – but difficult to use as a basis for calculation.
A more practical answer depends on the fact that N = 2 theories in two
dimensions are richly endowed with quantities that are invariant under adding to
R
the Lagrangian a term of the form d4 θ (. . .) (with . . . a gauge invariant operator).
Such quantities include Tr(−1)F , the elliptic genus, and the observables of two
30

twisted topological field theories (the A model and the B model), and of a so far
little studied hybrid, the half-twisted model. Let us call these the quasi-topological
quantities. Any such quantities are invariant under the addition of a term such
as (3.24) to the Lagrangian, so they can be computed using the “wrong” Kahler
metric on X.
Moreover, once one is reconciled to studying primarily the quasi-topological
quantities, it is easy to see that our problem with the e dependence can be resolved
in essentially the same way. The e dependent term in the Lagrangian is
1
− 2
4e

Z

d2 yd4θ ΣΣ,

(3.25)

so the quasi-topological quantitities are independent of e. The dependence on the
Fayet-Iliopoulos and theta terms can be similarly analyzed, with the result that
some quasi-topological terms are invariant under these couplings and others vary
holomorphically in t.
Indices
The simplest quasi-topological quantities are simply the indices of various operators (in canonical quantization on a circle). Let H and P be, as above, the
Hamiltonian and momentum of the theory, and let H± = (H ± P )/2. It is possible

to find a linear combination Q of the supercharges Q± and Q± such that Q is
self-adjoint and Q2 = H. Let (−1)F be the operator that counts the number of
fermions modulo two, and so anti-commutes with Q. The object Tr(−1)F e−βH is
independent of β by standard arguments (involving a pairing of states at non-zero
H that comes from multiplication by Q). This quantity is the index of Q (or more
properly of the piece of Q that maps states even under (−1)F to odd states). It is
usually written simply
Tr(−1)F .

(3.26)

This index is independent of r and θ (as long as we keep away from the singularity
31

at r = θ = 0) because of the discrete spectrum for H below a critical value; so it
has the same value for Landau-Ginzburg as for Calabi-Yau.
A similar but much more refined invariant can be constructed using the left
H
H
and right-moving R symmetry of the theory. Let WL = JL and WR = JR be

the R charges; and let

(−1)FR = exp(iπWR )
(−1)FL = exp(iπWL ).

(3.27)

Then (−1)F = (−1)FL (−1)FR . Let QR = (Q+ + Q+ )/2, so QR anticommutes with
(−1)FR and commutes with (−1)FL , and QR 2 = H+ . By a standard argument (a
pairing of states at H+ 6= 0 that comes from multiplication by QR ), the quantity
Tr(−1)FR q H− eiθWL exp(−βH+ )

(3.28)

is independent of β; we denote this as
F (q, θ) = Tr(−1)FR q H− eiθWL .

(3.29)

This quantity, which can be interpreted as the index of QR , is essentially the
elliptic genus of the model [26–28]; it has interesting modular properties that can
be established from its path integral representation. Given the discrete spectrum
for H+ below a critical value, F (q, θ) is invariant under variation of supersymmetric
parameters, so it is a topological invariant and moreover has the same value for
Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg. (In the Landau-Ginzburg case, this function
has not been previously studied; it has quite interesting properties that will be
explored elsewhere.)
P
In case i Qi is even but not zero, F (q, θ) is still an invariant provided we
P
restrict θ to integer multiples of 2π ( i Qi )−1 (corresponding to anomaly-free dis-

crete R symmetries) and provided we take due account of the vacuum states at
P
large σ. The even-ness of i Qi is needed to ensure that (−1)FR is not anomalous;

at low energies, it results in the target space of the r >> 0 sigma model being a
spin manifold, a natural requirement in defining the elliptic genus.

Continuation To Euclidean World-Sheet; Twisting
So far in this paper, the two dimensional world-sheet has had a Lorentzian
signature. For our remaining applications, a Euclidean world-sheet is more natural.
We make the analytic continuation to a Euclidean signature world-sheet by setting
y 0 = −iy 2 ; the line element ds2 = −(dy 0 )2 +(dy 1 )2 becomes ds2 = (dy 1)2 +(dy 2 )2 .
These linear sigma models not only are not topologically invariant; they are
not even conformally invariant, except (putatively) in the infrared limit. However,
as for any N = 2 supersymmetric models in two dimensions, topological field
theories can be constructed by a simple twisting procedure [29,24,30]. This involves
substituting the stress tensor by
Tαβ → Tαβ +


1
ǫα γ ∂γ (JRβ ± JLβ ) + α ↔ β .
4

(3.30)

One obtains two models, depending on the choice of sign. For the + and − sign

respectively one gets the so-called B model and A model. The B model is anomaP
lous unless i Qi = 0, so our discussion of it is limited to that case. There is no
such restriction for the A model (but the A model has very special properties when
P
i Qi = 0, for only then the instanton sums are infinite).

The point of the twisting procedure is that certain supercharges come to have

Lorentz spin zero if Lorentz transformations are defined using the modified stress
tensor. These are Q+ and Q− for the B model, and Q− and Q+ for the A model.
As these quantities are Lorentz invariant, they remain symmetries when the models
are formulated on an arbitrary Riemann surface Σ of genus g. Thus either the A
or the B model, formulated on any surface Σ, has a (0|2) dimensional supergroup
F of symmetries.
Let Q = Q+ + Q− or Q = Q− + Q+ for the B or A model; then in either case
Q2 = 0. It is natural to try to think of Q as a sort of BRST operator, considering
physical states to be the cohomology classes of Q and the observables to be correlation functions of Q invariant vertex operators. One can show, as in classical Hodge
33

theory, that BRST cohomology classes have F -invariant representatives; this leads
to some useful simplifications.
In either of the twisted models, one has Tαβ = {Q, Λαβ } for some Λαβ ; this

condition ensures that the correlation functions of Q-invariant operators are independent of the metric. So the twisted models become topological field theories; we
call their observables the topological correlation functions. As explained in detail
in [24], the topological observables of the A and B models include as special cases
the ac and cc chiral rings of the untwisted model, which determine the low energy
Yukawa couplings of the string compactification defined by the untwisted model.
R
Any perturbation of the Lagrangian of the form d2 y d4 θ . . . can be written

as {Q, . . .}, so the topological observables are invariant under such perturbations.

In particular, the topological observables are independent of the gauge coupling e.
For other couplings the basic rule is as follows. In the B model, any term in the
R +
R −
Lagrangian that can be written as dθ . . . or dθ . . . is {Q, . . .}, while in the
R
R +
A model this is true for any term that can be written as dθ− . . . or dθ . . ..
Looking at the definition of the superpotential couplings,

we see that the observables of the A model are independent of the superpotential
while the observables of the B model vary holomorphically with W .

we see that the topological observables of the B model are independent of r and θ
while those of the A model vary holomorphically in t.
The A model has a greatly enriched variant in which one ignores Q− and
considers Q+ as a BRST operator; thus physical states or vertex operators are
34

cohomology classes of Q+ . (The space of physical states of the half-twisted model
is infinite dimensional; the elliptic genus (3.29) is essentially the index of the Q+
operator.) This variant of the A model is called the half-twisted model. The halftwisted model is not a topological field theory; if this model is formulated on a
Riemann surface Σ, its correlation functions are conformally invariant (even if the
untwisted model was not) and vary holomorphically with the complex structure of
Σ. The correlation functions of the half-twisted model are invariant under change in
e and vary holomorphically with both W and t, by essentially the above arguments.
Since the interpolation between Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg is obtained
by varying t, we can draw some conclusions: the topological observables of the
B model are the same for Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg; for the A and halftwisted models, Landau-Ginzburg is an analytic continuation of Calabi-Yau.

3.4. The Twisted Models In Detail

We will now examine more closely the B and A models. (The half-twisted
model can be considered together with the A model in what follows.) The basic
tool is a sort of fixed point theorem discussed in [24,§5]. We recall that either the
A or B model has a (0|2) dimensional supergroup F of symmetries, with fermionic
generators that we will call Qσ . F -invariant representatives can be picked for all
of the vertex operators, so F can be regarded as a symmetry of the path integral.
The evaluation of the path integral for topological correlation functions can
be localized on the space Z of fixed points of F , that is the space of points in
field space for which {Qσ , Λ} = 0 for every field Λ and each σ. If the Qσ have a
simple zero along Z, then the path integral over modes normal to Z gives a simple

factor of ±1 due to cancellations between bosons and fermions. Otherwise, the

path integral reduces to an integral over a finite dimensional space of directions in
field space in which the Qσ vanish to higher than first order.
35

The B Model
⋆

In the B model, by considering {Q± , λ± } = 0, one finds D = v12 = 0. Let

Φα be the chiral superfields with components φα , ψα , Fα and charges Qα . By

setting {Q± , ψα± } = 0, one gets F = 0. From {Q± , ψα± } = 0, one learns that
Dφα /Dy i = 0, and that Qα φα σ = 0 for all α. For either r >> 0 or r << 0, the

equations D = Fα = 0 require that the quantitites Qα φα are not all zero, so the
last equation implies that σ = 0.
In sum then, for the B model, an F fixed point is simply a constant map
from the world-sheet Σ to the space of classical vacua. For r >> 0, the space of
classical vacua is the target space X of the low energy sigma model. In this case,
the generators Qσ have simple zeros along their space Z ∼
= X of zeroes, so the path
integral reduces to an integral over X. This integral can be analyzed as in [24,§4];
correlation functions can be evaluated in terms of periods of differential forms on
X. For r << 0, the space of classical vacua is a point, so the Qσ have only one
zero, but this zero is degenerate; the path integral reduces to a finite dimensional
integral analyzed by Vafa [31].
The A Model
For the A model, the equations {Qσ , λ± } = 0 and {Qσ , λ± } = 0 give
D + v12 = 0
dσ = 0.
The equations {Qσ , ψα± } = 0 and {Qσ , ψ α± } = 0 similarly give

and t = ir + θ/2π; the substitution of r by −it takes account of the theta term in
the action.

37

Since the left hand side of (3.38) is positive definite, it follows that solutions
of (3.35) necessarily have N ≥ 0 if r > 0, and N ≤ 0 if r < 0. The “instanton expansion” for the evaluation of any topological observable is therefore an expansion
in instantons, of the general form
X

ak exp(2πikt),

(3.41)

k≥0

for r → ∞, or an expansion in anti-instantons, of the general form
X

bk exp(−2πikt),

(3.42)

k≥0

for r → −∞.
A standard vanishing theorem (a line bundle of negative degree cannot have a
non-zero holomorphic section) says that if (D1 + iD2 )φα = 0, then
φα = 0 unless sign(Qα ) = sign(N).

(3.43)

This follows from (3.36) if one uses the invariance of (D1 + iD2 )φ = 0 under
complex gauge transformations (discussed below) to set v12 = constant.
Let us now look more closely at the structure of the instantons and antiinstantons, for the case relevant to the simplest form of the C-Y/L-G correspondence: the case in which there are n chiral superfields Si of charge 1, and one chiral
superfield P of charge −n, and the superpotential is W = P G(Si ).
r << 0
The case of r << 0 is easier, so we consider it first. In view of (3.43), si = 0,
but p 6= 0. Vanishing of si ensures that Fα = 0. The remaining equations are
(D1 + iD2 )p = 0
v12 = e2 (−n|p|2 − r).

(3.44)

These are the equations of the Nielsen-Olesen abelian vortex line, and the qualitative properties of the solutions are well known.
38

√
The p field is massive, with a mass proportional to e r, and Compton wave√
length λ ∼ 1/e r. Because the p field has charge −n, the solutions of (3.44) can

have instanton number −k/n for arbitrary integer k ≥ 0. In an anti-instanton field

of instanton number −k/n, the p field vanishes at k (generically distinct) points

x1 . . . xk ∈ Σ, and the energy density of the anti-instanton field is concentrated

within a distance of order λ from those points. To a low energy observer, probing
distances much longer than λ, the field looks like it is concentrated at k points;
it looks like a superposition of k point anti-instantons each of instanton number
−1/n.
Around one of the xa , where the p field has a simple zero, it changes in phase
by 2π. The si , of charge 1, therefore change in phase by −2π/n. Therefore, from

the point of view of the low energy effective theory of the massless fields si , it
looks like “twist fields,” about which the si change in phase by −2π/n, have been

inserted at the k points xa . Of course, in a global situation, on a compact Riemann

surface Σ, the total change in phase of the si must be a multiple of 2π, so k must
be divisible by n. This was to be expected; it is the standard quantization of the
instanton number in the presence of fields of charge 1.
We see therefore the interpretation of the parameters r, θ in the LandauGinzburg theory of r << 0. There is a gas of twist fields, with a chemical potential
such that an amplitude with k twist fields receives a factor of

exp(−2πitk/n).

(3.45)

For vacuum amplitudes, or amplitudes with insertions of ordinary (untwisted)
fields, the number k of twist fields in the gas must be divisible by n. It is however
known in the theory of the Landau-Ginzburg model that the A model has BRST
invariant observables in the twisted sectors. A correlation function with, say, s
twist fields receives contributions only from values of k such that k + s is divisible
by n. For given s, let k0 be the smallest non-negative integer with k0 + s divisible
39

by n. A correlation function hT1 . . . Ts i of s twist fields is then proportional for

r → −∞ to

exp(−2πitk0 /n)

(3.46)

and in particular vanishes at r = −∞ unless k0 = 0. This means that at r = −∞
there is a selection rule not present otherwise: hT1 . . . Ts i = 0 unless s is divisible

by n. This selection rule corresponds to a quantum Zn symmetry that holds only
at r = −∞.
To recapitulate, let us emphasize that for r << 0, the low energy theory is a
Landau-Ginzburg theory, which does not have (smooth) instantons. The construction of smooth instanton solutions depends on the massive fields; the instanton
solutions are smooth at a fundamental level, but look like point singularities in the
low energy theory.
r >> 0
If conversely r >> 0, we are dealing with instantons rather than anti-

instantons; (3.43) forces p = 0. With the superpotential being W = P G(Si ),
the equations to be obeyed are
(D1 + iD2 )si = 0
G(si ) = 0
2

v12 = e (

|si | − r).

We will presently analyze the import of these equations, but first, without any
mathematical formalism, let me state the result that will arise. The low energy
theory for r >> 0 is a sigma model with target space a Calabi-Yau hypersurface
X ⊂ CPn−1 . We should certainly expect to find the instantons of the sigma model,

that is the holomorphic maps of Σ to X. However (just as for r << 0), we will also
find additional instantons that are perfectly smooth objects at the fundamental
level, with the massive fields present, but look like singular objects in the effective
40

low energy theory. These additional instantons have structure varying on a scale
proportional to the Compton wavelengths of the massive fields (and other structure
varying more smoothly).
The presence of these additional “singular” instantons means that the instanton
expansion of the linear sigma model studied in this paper cannot be expected
to coincide with the standard instanton expansion of the conformally invariant
nonlinear sigma model to which it reduces at low energies. However, conventional
renormalization theory tells us how they will be related. We should think about the
effects of integrating out the point-like instanton structures (along with all other
effects of the massive fields) to get an effective theory of the massless fields. This
theory must be a sigma model of some kind, with some effective values of r and
θ and some effective defining equation G = 0. (All other parameters are believed
to be “irrelevant” in the sense of the renormalization group.) Since the A model
observables do not depend on the particular polynomial G, the effect of integrating
out the point instantons should be simply to change the effective values of r and
θ. Thus, the instanton expansion of the linear sigma model should differ from the
conventional instanton expansion of the nonlinear sigma model by a redefinition of
the variable t.
Now I come to the mathematical analysis of (3.47). Obviously, these equations
are invariant under gauge transformations
si → eiλ si ,

v → v − dλ,

(3.48)

with real λ. Actually, it is easy to see that the first two equations in (3.47) are
invariant under (3.48) even if λ is complex. It is a very beautiful fact [32] that the
last equation in (3.47) can be interpreted as a condition that fixes the complex
gauge invariance of the first two equations. In other words, the space of solutions
of the first two equations, up to a complex gauge transformation, is the same as the
space of solutions of the set of three equations, up to a real gauge transformation.
(This can be regarded as an infinite dimensional analog of the relation between
complex and symplectic quotients summarized in the next section.)
41

So we can study simply the first two equations in (3.47), up to complex gauge
transformations. To make the analysis particularly simple, we will assume also that
the world-sheet Σ is of genus zero (the main case in standard applications of the A
model). This leads to simplification because any complex line bundle on Σ is O(k)
for some k. If u, v are homogeneous coordinates for Σ ∼
= CP1 , then a holomorphic
section of O(k) is just a holomorphic function of u, v that is homogeneous of degree
k. I will later use the same name O(k) to denote the analogous line bundle over
CPn−1 .

Up to a complex gauge transformation, the first equation in (3.47) simply says
that the si are holomorphic sections of O(k), k being the instanton number. Thus

si = si (u, v) are polynomials in u and v, homogeneous of degree k, explicitly
si (u, v) = si,k uk + si,k−1 uk−1 v + . . . + si,0 v k .

(3.49)

The overall scaling
si (u, v) → tsi (u, v),

t ∈ C∗

(3.50)

corresponds to the complex gauge transformations with constant gauge parameter;
these are isomorphisms of O(k). The second equation in (3.47) says that
G(s1 (u, v), . . . , sn (u, v)) = 0.

(3.51)

The moduli space of solutions of (3.47) is the space of degree k polynomials
s1 (u, v), . . . , sn (u, v) obeying (3.51), modulo (3.50).
Now let us consider the moduli space of the sigma model, that is the moduli
space of degree k holomorphic maps Φ : Σ → X, X being the hypersurface G = 0

in CPn−1 . This sigma model moduli space is easy to describe. Φ having degree
k means by definition that Φ∗ (O(1)) = O(k). The homogeneous coordinates si

of CPn−1 are holomorphic sections of O(1), so Φ∗ (si ) are holomorphic sections of
42

O(k). This means that any degree k holomorphic map Φ : CP1 → CPn−1 is of

the form

(u, v) → (s1 (u, v), . . . , sn (u, v))

(3.52)

with degree k polynomials s1 (u, v), . . . sn (u, v) which must obey (3.51). Since in
CPn−1 the si are not permitted to vanish simultaneously, these polynomials must
have no common zeroes. Conversely, if the si obey (3.51) and have no common
zeroes, the formula (3.52) describes a degree k holomorphic map CP1 → CPn−1 .
The relation between the two moduli spaces is now clear. Every sigma model
instanton comes from a solution of (3.47), but (3.47) has extra solutions, in which
the si (u, v) do have common zeroes for some u, v, not both zero. These extra
solutions are smooth objects in the underlying gauge theory, but near the common
√
zeroes of the si they have a scale of variation of order 1/e r; this is the “point-like”
behavior promised in our introductory remarks. These instantons show “point-like”
behavior only near the common zeroes of the si ; elsewhere they look like sigma
model instantons.
One might think that the condition that the si have common zeroes would be
obeyed only very exceptionally, so that the point-like instantons would perhaps
be irrelevant. As a preliminary to seeing that this is not so, let us work out the
dimension of the instanton moduli space. Equation (3.51) asserts the vanishing of
a polynomial in u, v homogeneous of degree kn, which therefore has an expansion
G(u, v) = akn ukn + akn−1 ukn−1 v + . . . + a0 v kn . The kn + 1 a’s can be written
out explicitly as polynomials of degree n in the (k + 1)n coefficients si,r . Allowing
also for the scaling relation (3.50), the dimension of the instanton moduli space is
expected to be (k + 1)n − (kn + 1) − 1 = n − 2 if everything is generic. It is known

that this is the actual dimension of the sigma model moduli space, for generic G.
(In the usual case of target space a quintic three-fold in CP4 , n − 2 = 3, and the

dimension is reduced to zero after dividing by the action of SL(2, C) on Σ.)

If now si (u, v) are a collection of degree k polynomials, obeying (3.51) and
having no common zeros, then sei (u, v) = (αu+βv)si(u, v) are a collection of degree
43

k + 1 polynomials, obeying (3.51), and with a common zero where αu + βv = 0.
After allowing for an irrelevant scaling of α, β, the sei depend on one more parameter

than the si ; thus, while the sigma model instantons depend on n − 2 parameters,

the point-like instantons with one common zero depend on n − 1 parameters. (And
the point-like instantons with w common zeros depend on n − 2 + w parameters.)
The point-like instantons are in no way exceptional, and they must be considered

in integrating out the massive fields to get an effective action for the massless fields.
Conventional renormalization lore suggests, as noted earlier, that their effect is to
induce a reparametrization of the variable t.

4. SOME GEOMETRICAL BACKGROUND
The construction of §3 has many generalizations, some of which we will explore

in §5. First, however, I want to explain some geometrical background that sheds

some light on the subject. These facts are not strictly necessary for reading §5,
but clarify some of the issues, especially when we come to considering changes of
topology in §5.5. In effect we will be explaining, in an elementary and ad hoc
way, the relation (see [33] or [34, p. 158]) between symplectic and holomorphic
quotients.
Consider the manifold Y = Cn+1 with coordinates s1 , . . . , sn and p, and with
the C∗ action
si → λsi
p → λ−n p

(4.1)

for λ ∈ C∗ . We want to form a quotient of Y by C∗ . The relevance of this will

gradually become clear. Since C∗ acts freely on Y minus the origin O, one might

think that one could straightforwardly form a reasonable quotient (Y − O)/C∗ .
For a free action of a compact group, a reasonable quotient always exists, but the
story is quite different for non-compact groups.
Let P be a point in Y with p = 0, and let P ′ be a point in Y with s1 = . . . =
sn = 0. Under the C∗ action, P can be brought arbitrarily close to the origin (by
44

taking λ → 0), and the same can be done to P ′ (by taking λ → ∞). Even if we

delete the origin in forming the quotient, any neighborhood of P has a C∗ orbit

that intersects any neighborhood of P ′ . This means that the set theoretic quotient
(Y − O)/C∗, with its natural induced topology, is not a Hausdorff space.
Let Y1 be the subset of Y with p = 0 and the si not all 0; let Y2 be the subset
si = 0, p 6= 0. The C∗ orbits that come arbitrarily close to the origin are (apart
from O itself) the orbits in Y1 or Y2 . If Ye = Y − (Y1 ∪ Y2 ∪ O), then since Ye only
contains “good” C∗ orbits (that are closed and bounded away from the origin),
and C∗ acts freely on Ye , the quotient space Ye /C∗ is a manifold, just as if C∗ were

compact. Deleting Y1 , Y2 , and O is too crude, however; by suitably including some
of the ill-behaved orbits one can obtain natural partial compactifications of Ye /C∗ .
In the simple case that we have considered, it is not hard to guess how to

do this. And there is a systematic theory (geometric invariant theory [34]; for an
introduction see Newstead’s book [35]). Instead of studying this situation purely
mathematically, let us return to the physics problem of §3.1. In that problem, Y
P
was endowed with the Kahler metric dτ 2 = i |dsi |2 + |dp|2 . This Kahler metric is

not C∗ invariant, so C∗ is not a symmetry group of the N = 2 supersymmetric field
theory studied in §3. The metric is, however, invariant under the maximal compact

subgroup U(1) ⊂ C∗ (whose action is given by (4.1) with |λ| = 1). This U(1) was

used in §3 as the gauge group. The Kahler form associated with the Kahler metric
P
dτ 2 is ω = −i i ds̄i ∧ dsi − idp̄ ∧ dp. The U(1) action on Y preserves this Kahler

form. Since Y is simply connected, there inevitably is a Hamiltonian function that

generates by Poisson brackets the U(1) action on Y ; it is simply
X
e = −D =
|si |2 − n|p|2 − r,
D
2
e

(4.2)

i

with r being an arbitrary constant. The D function that played such an important
role in §3 is thus simply the generator, in this sense, of the gauge group.
In §3, it was natural to set D = 0, so as to minimize the energy, and then divide

by the gauge group. The combined operation of setting D = 0 and then dividing
45

by U(1) gives what is called the symplectic quotient of Y by U(1). The symplectic
quotient of Y by U(1), often denoted Y //U(1), depends on r, of course. Even the
topology of Y //U(1) changes when r passes through certain distinguished values
at which Y //U(1) is singular – in our example this occurs only at r = 0. And when
the topology is not changing, the sympectic structure of Y //U(1) still depends on r.
Y //U(1) has a natural symplectic structure obtained by restricting ω to D = 0 and
then projecting to the quotient Y //U(1) = {D = 0}/U(1). This natural symplectic

structure determines an element of H 2 (Y //U(1), R) which depends linearly on r;
this is related to the Duistermaat-Heckman integration formula [36].
However, if we consider not Y but Ye , certain simplifications arise: Ye //U(1)

is in a certain sense naturally independent of r. To see this, we consider the D
function restricted to a particular C∗ orbit. It is
e
D(λ)
= |λ|2

X
i

|si |2 − n|λ|−2n |p|2 − r.

(4.3)

e
Because we are in Ye , the coefficients of |λ|2 and |λ|−2n are both non-zero. D(λ)
is

a monotonic function of |λ| which goes to +∞ for λ → ∞ and to −∞ for λ → 0.
e
It follows that D(λ)
= 0 for a unique value of |λ|.
The given C∗ orbit contributes, of course, precisely one point to the quotient
Ye /C∗ . It also contributes precisely one point to Ye //U(1), since |λ| is uniquely

determined by requiring D = 0, and the argument of λ is absorbed in the U(1)
action. Therefore, Ye //U(1) coincides naturally with Ye /C∗ .
From the symplectic point of view, there is no mystery about how to include

the bad points – the origin O and the points in Y1 and Y2 . The result, however,
depends on r:
(i) For r > 0, setting D = 0 is possible in Y1 but not for the other bad points.
The symplectic quotient Q = Y1 //U(1) is a copy of CPn−1 , with Kahler form
proportional to r. So Y //U(1) is the union of Ye /C∗ with this CPn−1 .
46

(ii) For r = 0, the origin is the only bad point with D = 0. Its sympectic
quotient is a single point, and Y //U(1) is the union of Ye /C∗ with this point.

(iii) For r < 0, setting D = 0 is possible in Y2 but not for the other bad points.

The symplectic quotient Y2 //U(1) is a single point, and Y //U(1) is the union of
Ye /C∗ with this point.
Since Q = Y1 //U(1) is the same as Y1 /C∗ (both being CPn−1 ), and similarly

Y2 //U(1) = Y2 /C∗ (both being a point), we can restate these results holomorphically. Let us do this in detail for r > 0 and for r < 0:
(i) For r > 0, Y //U(1) is the same as Z = Y ′ /C∗ , where Y ′ = Ye ∪ Y1 is the

union of the points at which the si are not all zero. Z is fibered over CPn−1 (by
forgetting p). The fiber is a copy of the complex plane, parametrized by p. Z is
therefore a complex line bundle over CPn−1 ; in fact, in view of the transformation
law in (4.1), Z is the total space of the line bundle O(−n). Z is actually a nonP
compact Calabi-Yau manifold. To see this, begin with the equation i Qi = 0

that played such an important role in §3 (the Qi being here the exponents in
(4.1)). This equation ensures that the n + 1 form Θ = ds1 ∧ . . . ∧ dsn ∧ dp is C∗

invariant. Contracting Θ with the vector field generating the C∗ action, we get an
everywhere non-zero holomorphic n-form Θ′ whose restriction to Y ′ is the pullback
of a holomorphic n-form on Z = Y ′ /C∗ .
(iii) For r < 0, Y //U(1) is the same as Y ′′ /C∗ where Y ′′ = Ye ∪ Y2 is the region

with p 6= 0. We can therefore use the C∗ action on (si , p) to set p = 1. This leaves

a residual invariance under the subgroup of U(1) defined by λn = 1. Dividing

by this group, Y //U(1) for r < 0 is the same as Z ′ = Cn /Zn . This is again a
P
non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold, by virtue of i Qi = 0.
There are two main conclusions:

(a) Y //U(1) carries a natural complex structure for any r. It is evident “physically” that this must be so, since the low energy limit of the models studied in
§3 is (if we set the superpotential to zero) an N = 2 sigma model with this target
47

space. (The analog of this reasoning for N = 4 leads to the celebrated hyper-Kahler
quotient [18].)
(b) The various complex manifolds Y //U(1) for r positive, negative, or zero are
all equivalent to each other on dense open sets, since on a dense open set they all
coincide with Y ′ /C∗ . The technical term for this is that these complex manifolds
are birationally equivalent. In fact, we can be more specific. Z is obtained by
blowing up the origin in Z ′ – replacing the origin in Z ′ = Cn /Zn (which originated
as Y2 //U(1)) with a copy of CPn−1 ∼
= Y1 //U(1).
Though I have illustrated the ideas in a very special case, these conclusions are
general [33,34]. Given an action of a compact group G on, for instance, Y = Cn
or on a projective variety (endowed with a choice of Kahler metric) the various
possible symplectic quotients Y //G (obtained from different choices of D functions)
carry natural complex structures and are all birationally equivalent to one another.
Indeed, they can all be identified on a dense open set with Ye /GC , where Ye is a
suitable dense open set in Y , and GC is the complexification of G.

The technique of §3 is really a technique for interpolating between sigma models

with birationally equivalent target spaces, obtained by varying the D functions.

This technique can be applied in the absence of any superpotential, in which case it
leads directly to relations between some sigma models with birationally equivalent
targets. We will pick up this theme in §5.5 in connection with transitions in the
topology of space-time.

On the other hand, if one begins with a C∗ -invariant holomorphic function W
on Y – serving as a superpotential – then W will descend to a holomorphic funcc – serving as a superpotential – on any of the symplectic quotients Y //G.
tion W
Thus, any relation between sigma models with birationally equivalent targets obtained by the method of §3 extends to the case in which these spaces are endowed

with “common” superpotentials, that is superpotentials that come from a common underlying gauge invariant function on Y . In general, birational equivalence
is the condition under which it makes sense to speak in this way of the “same”
48

holomorphic function on different complex manifolds.
For instance, in the case treated in §3, the underlying superpotential was W =

pG(si ), with G being homogeneous of degree n. For r > 0, W restricts and descends
c on the symplectic quotient Z. The effective theory
to a holomorphic function W

after integrating out the massive gauge multiplet is a theory with target space Z
c ; by essentially the computations of §3, it reduces at low
and superpotential W

energies to the sigma model of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface G = 0 in CPn−1 ⊂ Z.
On the other hand, for r < 0, W restricts and descends to the holomorphic
function G(si ) on Z ′ = Cn /Zn . This is the superpotential of the familiar LandauGinzburg orbifold.
In this way, the birational equivalence between Z and Z ′ lies behind the CY/L-G correspondence. The basic relation is the one between quantum field theory
on Z and on Z ′ ; the C-Y/L-G correspondence arises upon examining this relation
in the presence of a particular common superpotential.

5. GENERALIZATIONS
Our task in this section is to describe some generalizations of the CalabiYau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence. We will first consider fairly immediate
generalizations, involving (i) hypersurfaces in a weighted projective space; (ii) hypersurfaces in products of projective spaces and in more general toric varieties;
(iii) hypersurfaces in Grassmannians; (iv) intersections of hypersurfaces in any of
those spaces. In each case, the discussion will be rather brief because most of
the discussion in §3 carries over with obvious modifications. Finally, in §5.5, we

will discuss the occurrence in this framework of transitions between manifolds of
different topology. The framework of §4 is useful background, especially for §5.5.

49

5.1. Hypersurfaces In Weighted Projective Space
The most obvious slight generalization of what we have already done in §3 is

the following. Consider a U(1) gauge theory with n chiral superfields Si , i = 1 . . . n,
P
of charge qi , and one more chiral superfield P of charge − i qi . By rescaling the

U(1) generator, one can assume that the qi are relatively prime.
P
The above choice of charges ensures that i Qi = 0, a condition which as we

saw in §3 leads to anomaly-free left- and right-moving R symmetry and hence to

Calabi-Yau manifolds at low energies. In our subsequent examples, we will always
P
ensure in a similar way that i Qi = 0, for each U(1) charge, without pointing

this out explicitly in each case.

We take the superpotential to be
W = P G(Si),

(5.1)

P

where G is a polynomial of charge q =

i qi , transverse in the sense that the

equations

∂G
∂G

(5.2)

are obeyed only at S1 = . . . = Sn = 0. (Existence of such a G is a severe restriction
on the qi , analyzed in [37], but if any G of charge q obeys this condition, the generic
one does.) The part of the Lagrangian containing the chiral superfields is thus

Since we will have to write similar formulas many times, we will adopt a few
P
conventions. The symbol α will always involve a sum over all chiral superfields
Φα , with auxiliary fields Fα . The terms in the potential involving σ always have

the effect of giving σ a mass and forcing its vacuum expectation value to vanish
(away from phase boundaries; the behavior near phase boundaries is always as
explained in §3.2). Knowing this, σ can be dropped from the discussion, and the
potential can be written only at σ = 0.

The analysis proceeds as in §3.1. One step in finding the ground state structure

is to set D = 0 and divide by the gauge group U(1) (forming the symplectic quotient

of Cn+1 by U(1), in the language of §4). If r >> 0, the locus D = 0 divided by

U(1) is a copy of the weighted projective space WCPn−1
q1 ,...,qn , with Kahler class

proportional to r. The low energy theory is a sigma model whose target space is
the hypersurface G = 0 in that weighted projective space. This hypersurface is
a Calabi-Yau manifold because of the underlying R-invariance. The assumption
that the qi are relatively prime means that (away from singularities of the weighted
projective space) the gauge symmetry is completely broken.
On the other hand, for r << 0, the field p gets a vacuum expectation value,
breaking the gauge group down to Zq . There is a unique vacuum, with si = 0
p
and p =
−r/q, up to a gauge transformation. The low energy theory is a
Zq orbifold with superpotential G(s1 , . . . , sn ). We have recovered the standard

correspondence between Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective space
and Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds.

51

5.2. Hypersurfaces In Toric Varieties
Now I want to consider a case in which we will discover something new, instead
of just recovering known results. To avoid cluttering up the notation, I begin by
considering a very special case of a hypersurface in a product of projective spaces,
say CPn−1 × CPm−1 .
First of all, to describe CPn−1 × CPm−1 , we consider a U(1) × U(1) gauge

theory with two vector superfields, say V1 and V2 , with gauge couplings e1 and e2 .
There are therefore two independent Fayet-Iliopoulos terms, in components

LD = −

Z

d2 y (r1 D1 + r2 D2 ) .

(5.7)

We introduce superfields Si , i = 1 . . . n, of charges (1, 0), Tj , j = 1 . . . m, of charges
(0, 1), and one more superfield P of charges (−n, −m). The kinetic energy of these

fields is thus

For the superpotential, we take

where G is a polynomial homogeneous of degree n in the Si and of degree m in the
Tj , and transverse in the sense that the equations

(5.12)

Now, let us analyze the vacuum structure. Transversality of G means that
(5.12) vanishes precisely if either (i) p = 0 and G = 0; or (ii) si = 0, i = 1 . . . n,
with suitable values of other fields; or (iii) tj = 0, j = 1 . . . m, with suitable values
of other fields. These three choices correspond to three phases of the theory, which
we will call phase I, phase II, and phase III.
Which phase is realized depends on the values of the ri . Upon setting (5.11)
to zero, one finds that phase I is realized for r1 , r2 ≥ 0; phase II for r1 ≤ 0,

nr2 − mr1 ≥ 0; and phase III for r2 ≤ 0, nr2 − mr1 ≤ 0. The phase boundaries are

thus the half-lines r1 = 0, r2 ≥ 0, r2 = 0, r1 ≥ 0, and r1 , r2 ≤ 0, nr2 − mr1 = 0 in
the r1 − r2 plane. These phase boundaries divide the plane into regions of phase

I, II, or III.

Phase I is the familiar Calabi-Yau phase. In this phase, the expectation values
P
of si and tj break the gauge group completely. In the vacuum, p = 0, i |si |2 = r1 ,
P
2
j |tj | = r2 . Upon dividing by the gauge group U(1) × U(1), the si and tj

determine a point in CPn−1 × CPm−1 with Kahler classes proportional to r1 , r2 .

Since the vanishing of (5.12) requires also G = 0 (and all modes not tangent to

the solution space of G = 0 are massive), the low energy theory is a sigma model
of the hypersurface G = 0 in CPn−1 × CPm−1 . Because G is of bidegree (n, m),
this is actually a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.

Now let us consider phase II. In this region, p and tj have vacuum expectation
values, spontaneously breaking the gauge group to Zn . The expectation values
53

obey
|p| =

(5.13)

By a gauge transformation, one can assume that p > 0. This leaves the residual
gauge invariance
tj → exp(iθ) · tj ,

si → exp(−i(m/n)θ) · si .

(5.14)

The value of tj , after imposing the second equation in (5.13) and the gauge invariance in (5.14), determines a point in CPm−1 . Because si transforms as in
(5.14) under this gauge transformation, the si should be considered to define not
a point in Cn but a point in the fiber of an n dimensional complex vector bundle
Y over CPm−1. (If m/n is not an integer, this is not an ordinary vector bundle
but a V -bundle, the vector bundle analog of an orbifold.) Setting p to its vacuum
expectation value, there is an effective superpotential given by the holomorphic
p
function Wef f = −r1 /n · G(si , tj ) on Y . Phase II is thus a peculiar hybrid of
a CPm−1 sigma model in the t directions and a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold in the

s directions This is our first encounter with such a hybrid, but we will see that
hybrids of various kinds are ubiquitous.
Phase III can, of course, be treated in the same way and is a similar hybrid of
a CPn−1 sigma model and a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold.
One may wonder if it is possible to describe a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a
product of projective spaces by a more ordinary Landau-Ginzburg model. The
closest we can come to this is to go to the phase boundary between phase II and
phase III, setting r1 , r2 < 0 and mr1 − nr2 = 0. Then there is up to gauge
p
transformation a unique classical vacuum with si = tj = 0, p =
−r1 /n =
p
−r2 /m. The vacuum expectation value of p breaks the gauge group to H =
U(1) × Zd , where d is the greatest common divisor of n and m. The low energy

theory is a gauged Landau-Ginzburg model, with gauge group H.
54

As an example, take n = m = 3, with G(Si , Tj ) homogeneous of degree (3, 3).
On the boundary between phase II and phase III, the unbroken gauge group is
H = U(1) × Z3 ; U(1) acts as Si → exp(iθ) · Si , Tj → exp(−iθ) · Tj , and Z3

multiplies the Si by a cube root of unity while leaving Tj invariant. The low
energy theory is described by the effective action

where the parameter r measures the distance from the II-III phase boundary. Precisely for r = 0, the model has an isolated classical vacuum at the origin and
unbroken gauge invariance. The model is then a gauged Landau-Ginzburg model
at low energies.
Gauged Landau-Ginzburg models can be analyzed like ordinary ones. For
ordinary Landau-Ginzburg models, the contribution of the untwisted sectors to
the (c, c) chiral ring (the chiral ring of the B model) is the ring of polynomials
A(Si , Tj ) in the chiral fields modulo the usual relations generated by ∂G/∂Si ,
∂G/∂Tj . For a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold, one requires that A be invariant under
the appropriate discrete symmetry. For a gauged Landau-Ginzburg model, A must
be gauge invariant. (As we learned in §3.1, orbifolds are simply a special case of
gauge theories with finite gauge group.) In the present case, gauge invariance
can be imposed as follows: a U(1) invariant homogenous polynomial in Si and Tj
must be of equal degree in Si and Tj , while Z3 invariance says that this degree
must be divisible by three. The chiral ring thus consists of polynomials of bidegree
(0, 0), (3, 3), (6, 6), and (9, 9). It seems unlikely that this model can be described
by an ordinary (ungauged) Landau-Ginzburg model. Without the requirement of
continuous gauge invariance, the (c, c) chiral ring would be infinite dimensional.
More General Toric Varieties
A generalization is to consider a model with N chiral superfields S1 , . . . , SN ,
and one more chiral superfield P , and with gauge group H = U(1)d . In the previous
55

example, N = n + m and d = 2. One can think of the Si as linear functions on
V = CN . We suppose that the j th copy of U(1) acts by Si → exp(iθqij ) · Si with
P
integers qij , and P → exp(−iθqj )P , with qj = i qij . We pick the superpotential

to be W = P G(S1 , . . . , SN ) where G has charge qj under the j th copy of U(1).
The potential energy is

(5.18)

If one temporarily restricts to p = 0, then setting the Dj to 0 and dividing by
H, one obtains a so-called symplectic quotient of V = CN by H, as discussed in
§4. This quotient, call it Z, is of real dimension 2(N − d), and obviously admits an

action of a group F = U(1)N −d (the phase rotations of the si that have not been

included in H). Actually (once the rj are picked), Z is naturally a Kahler manifold
– this is obvious in the formalism of N = 2 supersymmetry; mathematically, the
complex structure on Z can be constructed using the relation between symplectic
and holomorphic quotients, as sketched in §4. Using the complex structure on Z,
⋆

the F action on Z can be analytically continued to an action of FC = (C∗ )N −d .

Z and FC have the same complex dimension N − d and FC acts freely on a

dense open set in Z; Z is therefore a so-called toric variety. Under some restriction

⋆ The FC action on Z = V //H can be constructed concretely as follows. The F action on
V is generated by transformations si → λei si with λ ∈ U (1) and certain exponents ei . By
permitting λ ∈ C∗ , one extends the F action on V to an FC action; as this commutes with
H, it descends to an FC action on V /HC , which as we know from §4 coincides with V //H
on a dense open set.
56

on the qij , Z is compact. This is true if for some j the qij are all positive. (It
P
is true more generally if for some positive numbers mj , one has j qij mj > 0 for

all i; this however is not a very essential generalization as one can reduce to the
previous case by an automorphism of the gauge group U(1)d .) Conversely, every
compact toric variety can be obtained in this way [38, 39].

The equation G = 0 defines a hypersurface X in Z. As a hypersurface in a
toric variety, X is called a toric hypersurface. If we pick G to be transverse in the
sense that the equations
G=

∂G
=0
∂Si

(5.19)

are satisfied only for all Si = 0, then this hypersurface is smooth away from
singularities of Z; we henceforth consider only this case.
With Z and X as above and suitable rj (for instance rj > 0 precisely for some
value of j for which qj > 0), the condition U = 0 forces the si to not all vanish.
Then setting U to zero (and using the transversality of G), p and G must vanish
so the locus of classical ground states up to gauge transformation is precisely the
hypersurface X ⊂ Z. The low energy theory is a sigma model with this target
space.

On the other hand, by varying the rj , the system will undergo many phase
transitions. Some of these phase transitions will involve changes in the topology of
X, preserving the interpretation of the model as a Calabi-Yau sigma model (at low
energies), while changing the topology of space-time. The local behavior involved
in such topology change will be discussed in §5.5. Other phases of the system

will be hybrids of sigma models and Landau-Ginzburg models; one type of hybrid
appeared in the example treated at the beginning of this subsection. Finally, if we
set rj = −rqj (with some fixed r), then there is a unique classical vacuum up to

gauge transformation; it has |p|2 = r, si = 0. In this case, we get a description as

a gauged Landau-Ginzburg model, generalizing the case treated above. The gauge
group is U(1)d−1 × Zn , for some n. It is worth noting that Batyrev [40] gave a kind
57

of Landau-Ginzburg description of the cohomology of a general toric hypersurface;
the facts we have just explained presumably give a field theoretic setting for his
construction.
A General Comment
A smooth toric variety Z of dimension N − d, with H 2 (Z, R) being d dimen-

sional, can always be obtained as the symplectic quotient of CN by U(1)d . The
symplectic quotient CN //U(1)d depends on d parameters r1 , . . . , rd , the constant
terms that can be added to the D functions. In keeping with the DuistermaatHeckman theorem, starting from a fixed symplectic structure on CN , the natural
induced symplectic structure on Z = CN //U(1)d varies linearly with the ri . In
other words, in some basis ei of H 2 (Z, R), the Kahler class of Z = CN //U(1)d is
P
[ω] = i ri ei .

Now consider the Calabi-Yau hypersurface X ⊂ Z. H 2 (X, R) has some gener-

ators that can be found by restricting the cohomology of Z to X. The restriction
of H 2 (Z, R) may however give only part of H 2 (X, R) (as in the example studied
in [7]). In this case, the most general Kahler metric on X is not conveniently

obtained by embedding in Z, and the ri are only a subset of natural linear coordinates parametrizing the Kahler class of X. When this occurs, the phase diagram
we have constructed is not the full phase diagram of sigma models with target
space X, but its restriction to the subspace spanned by the ri .
5.3. Hypersurfaces in Grassmannians
Here we will consider a simple application of similar reasoning applied to a
model with a non-abelian gauge group. In fact, we will find a correspondence between sigma models with target space a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a Grassmannian and gauged Landau-Ginzburg models, this time with a non-abelian gauge
group. (Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in Grassmannians are discussed in Hubsch’s
book [41].) In contrast to our previous experience, in this example the occurrence
of a gauged Landau-Ginzburg model will be stable, not limited to special values of
58

the parameters, and therefore perhaps more interesting. Further generalizations,
using more complicated gauge groups or gauge groups in other representations,
should be obvious.
To begin with, we need a convenient realization of a sigma model with target
space a Grassmannian, say the Grassmannian of k planes in complex n space. To
achieve this, we start with kn chiral superfields S i λ , i = 1 . . . k, λ = 1 . . . n. We
think of the S i λ as matrix elements of a k × n matrix S; S will denote its adjoint.

The group G = U(k) acts on the S’s by

′

S i λ → M i i′ S i λ ,

(5.20)

for M i i′ ∈ U(k). To write a model with gauge group U(k), we introduce a k × k

hermitian matrix V of vector superfields. We take the Lagrangian to be the gauge
and matter kinetic energy plus a Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the central factor U(1) ⊂

U(k). The potential energy is (at σ = 0)
U(si λ ) =

is thus simply a sigma model with this target space. In mathematical terms, using
the language of §4, the above construction amounts to obtaining G(k, n) as the
†

symplectic quotient of Ckn by U(k).

To obtain a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in this Grassmannian, we introduce one
more complex superfield P , transforming under (5.20) as P → (det M)−n P . One

then takes the superpotential to be W = P G(S i λ ), where G is a polynomial that
transforms as G → (det M)n G. The formula for D is modified to

For r >> 0, the model can be analyzed in a now familiar fashion. Assuming
that G is chosen so that the hypersurface X ⊂ G(k, n) given by G = 0 is smooth,

vanishing of the potential implies that p = G = 0; the low energy theory is a
sigma model with target space X. For r << 0, under the same assumptions, the

model has a unique classical vacuum (up to gauge transformation) with < p >=
p
−r/kn, < si λ >= 0. The expectation value of p breaks the gauge group from
U(k) to the subgroup H of U(k) consisting of matrices whose determinant is an
nth root of 1. (H is an extension of SU(k) by Zn .) The model at low energies
is a gauged Landau-Ginzburg model with massless chiral superfields S i λ , effective
superpotential Wef f =< p > G(S i λ ), and gauge group H.
† Alternatively, the Grassmannian can be realized as a holomorphic quotient as follows. By
allowing M ∈ GL(k, C), (5.20) defines a GL(k, C) action on Ckn ; the Grassmannian is the
quotient by GL(k, C) of a dense open set in Ckn consisting of good orbits that contain
zeros of the moment map. These are precisely the orbits on which the vectors w(i) = si λ eλ
are linearly independent.

An Example
Here is a convenient and amusing example (see [41], p. 101). One of the
simplest examples of a Calabi-Yau manifold X is an intersection G1 = G2 = 0
in CP5 , with G1 and G2 being respectively polynomials homogeneous of degree
two and of degree four in homogeneous coordinates T1 , . . . , T6 of CP5 . It does not
seem that this model has an ordinary Landau-Ginzburg realization. However, it
has a gauged Landau-Ginzburg phase, since (for a smooth quadric G1 ) the locus
G1 = 0 in CP5 is equivalent to a copy of G(2, 4). Hence, X can be realized as a
hypersurface in G(2, 4), and studied as above.
This may be seen explicitly as follows. Instead of thinking of the Ti as a six
component “column vector,” arrange them as components of a 4 × 4 antisymmet-

ric tensor Tλβ = −Tβλ , λ, β = 1 . . . 4. There is no invariant information in the

choice of the quadratic polynomial G1 , assuming it is non-degenerate, since all
non-degenerate quadrics are equivalent up to a linear change of coordinates. A
convenient choice of G1 is
G1 = ǫαβγδ Tαβ Tγδ

(5.25)

with ǫαβγδ the Levi-Civita tensor. The equation G1 = 0 can be solved in terms of
eight complex variables S i λ , i = 1, 2, λ = 1 . . . 4, by
Tλδ = ǫij S i λ S j δ

(5.26)

with ǫij again the Levi-Civita tensor. Two S i λ ’s give T ’s that are proportional
(and so define the same point in CP5 ) precisely if they differ by S i λ → M i i′ S i λ ,
′

M being in GL(2, C). Since this equivalence relation on the S’s is the one that
leads to G(2, 4), this completes the explanation of the isomorphism of the quadric
G1 = 0 in CP5 with G(2, 4).
We want to study the Calabi-Yau manifold X given by the equations G1 =

G2 = 0 in CP5 , with G1 (Tλ ) as above and G2 a quartic polynomial in the T ’s.
Under the substitution (5.26), G2 (T ) becomes an eighth order, SL(2, C) invariant
61

e

polynomial G(S).
X is equivalent to the hypersurface G(S)
= 0 in G(2, 4). So

according to our general discussion of hypersurfaces in Grassmannians, the sigma
model with target space X can be studied by studying the U(2) gauge theory with
e
chiral superfields S i λ and superpotential W = P G(S).
Its phases can be found

as at the beginning of this section and are the Calabi-Yau phase and a gauged
Landau-Ginzburg phase.

5.4. Intersections Of Hypersurfaces
Now we will briefly discuss the application of these ideas to intersections of
hypersurfaces.
To avoid cluttering the notation, we will consider only the simplest case of
an intersection of hypersurfaces in a ordinary projective space, say CPn−1 with
projective coordinates s1 , . . . , sn . We consider hypersurfaces Ha , a = 1 . . . k defined
by the vanishing of homogeneous polynomials Ga of degree qa . The intersection X
P
of the Ha is a Calabi-Yau manifold if a qa = n. The condition that X is smooth
is that the Ha intersect transversely in the sense that for any complex numbers pa ,
not all zero, the equations
Ga =

X

pa

a

∂Ga
=0
∂si

(5.27)

have a common solution only for s1 = . . . = sn = 0.
To describe the hypersurface X along the general lines of the present paper,
we consider a U(1) gauge theory with chiral superfields Si of charge 1 and Pa of
P
charge −qa . We take the superpotential to be W = a Pa Ga (S1 , . . . , Sn ). The

ordinary potential is then

(5.30)

There are two phases. For r > 0, one uses the transversality condition (5.27)
to show (as we have done earlier in similar problems) that the space of classical
ground states is the variety X. For r < 0, the p’s have an expectation value, and
the s’s do not. The space of ground states is then a weighted projective space
W = WCPk−1
a1 ,...,an , and the low energy theory is a hybrid Landau-Ginzburg/sigma
model on a vector bundle over W .
Intersections of hypersurfaces in more general toric varieties (or Grassmannians, etc.) can be treated by obvious extensions of these remarks. In general, one
will get many phases, of all the types we have seen (Calabi-Yau, Landau-Ginzburg,
gauged Landau-Ginzburg, and various kinds of hybrid). One may wonder if there
are any cases in which one gets an ordinary Landau-Ginzburg phase as opposed to
a sigma model/L.G. hybrid. This occurs only in special cases, some of which are
of phenomenological interest. I will next describe such a case.
Landau-Ginzburg Models For Intersections Of Hypersurfaces
In CPn−1 × CPm−1 , with homogeneous coordinates s1 , . . . , sn and t1 , . . . , tm

for the two factors, we will consider the variety X defined by G1 = G2 = 0, the G’s
being bi-homogeneous polynomials in si and in tj . If Ga , a = 1, 2 is bi-homogeneous
in si , tj of degree (qa , qa′ ), then X is a Calabi-Yau manifold if q1 +q2 = n, q1′ +q2′ = m.
The condition that X is smooth is that for any complex numbers pa not both zero,
the equations
0 = G1 = G2 =

X

have no common solution unless the si or the tj are all zero. (Values of (si , tj )
with all si or all tj zero do not determine a point in CPn−1 × CPm−1.) This

transversality condition, however, is not sufficient to lead in our usual construction
63

to a Landau-Ginzburg model; it will lead to a hybrid Landau-Ginzburg/sigma
model similar to some we have seen above.
To construct a model with the sigma model of X as one of its phases, we
consider a U(1) × U(1) gauge theory, with chiral fields Si , i = 1 . . . n of charge

(1, 0), Tj , j = 1 . . . m of charge (0, 1), and two more fields Pa , a = 1, 2, of charge
P
(−qa , −qa′ ). We pick the superpotential to be W = a Pa Ga (Si , Tj ). The relevant

Setting all this to zero, one finds for r1 , r2 >> 0 a phase which describes at low energies a sigma model with target space X. In general there is a perhaps interesting
phase diagram with several phases, but none of these describes a Landau-Ginzburg
model. For instance, for r1 , r2 << 0, setting Da to zero requires p1 , p2 to not both
vanish. The vanishing of the Fα is then equivalent to (5.31), and the transversality
condition asserts that this requires that the si are all zero or the tj are all zero –
but not necessarily both. If the si are all zero, the tj are not uniquely determined,
and vice-versa. One therefore has not an isolated classical vacuum, leading to a
Landau-Ginzburg model, but a family of vacua with additional massless particles,
corresponding to a hybrid model. This particular hybrid model actually has a reducible target space (one branch with si = 0 and one with tj = 0) and a singularity
(other than the usual orbifold singularities) at the intersection si = tj = 0.
A Landau-Ginzburg model arises only if n, m and the qa , qa′ are such that, for
suitable values of r1 and r2 , vanishing of the classical potential forces the si and tj
64

⋆

all to vanish. This occurs only in very special cases. Some of these pecial cases are
of phenomenological interest. For instance, take n = 4, m = 3, (q1 , q1 ′ ) = (3, 0),
(q2 , q2 ′ ) = (1, 3). We take

We consider the region r1 << r2 << 0. Vanishing of (5.35) requires that p2 6= 0

and that either (a) p1 6= 0, or (b) p1 = 0, and the tj are not all zero. Case (b)

is incompatible with (5.31), which immediately implies that the tj are all zero if

p1 = 0, p2 6= 0. In case (a), (5.31) is easily seen to imply that si = tj = 0 for

all i and j. In this case, |p1 | and |p2 | are uniquely determined by (5.35). So for

this range of r1 and r2 , the model has a unique classical vacuum up to gauge
transformation and reduces at low energies to a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold. The
model is actually a Z9 orbifold, as the vacuum expectation values of p1 and p2 break
the gauge group to Z9 . The effective superpotential for the massless superfields

This model is of interest for two reasons. First of all, a suitable quotient
of the variety X by a finite group gives one of the first known and simplest three

or alternatively n ≥ m, (q1 , q1 ′ ) = (n − 1, 0), (q2 , q2 ′ ) = (1, m).

generation models, constructed originally by Schimmrigk [42]. Second, the LandauGinzburg description shows that the model is exactly soluble at a particular point
in its moduli space. Indeed, S 3 + ST 3 is the superpotential of the minimal model
with E7 modular invariant, while S 3 is that of the minimal model with A1 modular
invariant, so the model is a tensor product of three E7 minimal models and one
A1 model. It is in fact one of Gepner’s original models [43].
5.5. Change Of Topology
It has been a long-standing and fascinating question whether in string theory
physical processes can occur in which the topology of space-time changes. (Examples have been known, involving duality or mirror symmetry, of non-classical
equivalences between different topologies, but that is a somewhat different question.) Recently, Aspinwall, Greene, and Morrison [7] undertook to use mirror
symmetry to show that the answer is affirmative, at least in one special situation.
Though their starting point is quite different, their analysis ultimately involves the
same phase diagrams that we have been examining in this paper.
These phase diagrams can be very complicated in general and – as shown in
detail in [7] in a particular example – can contain a variety of Calabi-Yau phases,
with different smooth target spaces. Upon varying the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms,
transitions occur between the different target space-times. By arguments of §3.2,

the transitions are continuous if the θ angles are generic. In string theory, the

Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters (like all operators in the world-sheet Lagrangian) are
interpreted as expectation values of some fields in space-time; they are dynamical
variables, free to change in time. This gives a mechanism for physical topology
change.
The transitions that arise this way are transitions between topologically distinct but birationally equivalent Calabi-Yau manifolds. The reasons for this were
sketched in §4; in brief, the various symplectic quotients of a given target space

that one can construct by varying the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters can all be iden66

tified generically (on a dense open set) with a fixed complex quotient of the same
target.
While a global situation has been analyzed in [7], my discussion here will be
more modest in scope, focussing on the local mechanism of topology change. In
other words, we will analyze how, by varying the constant term in the D function,
we obtain a change of topology in a local region of space-time. The reader should
think of the space-time we will consider as being embedded as part of a compact
Calabi-Yau manifold, whose topology will change in the process we will consider.
The example that we will consider is in complex dimension three and is not
as special as it may appear. It is the generic “flop” (or birational transformation
not changing c1 ) considered in Mori theory (of birational classification of complex
manifolds; for a review see [44]) in complex dimension three. It is possible that
by introducing enough parameters, any birational transformation between threedimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds can be constructed as a succession of transformations each locally isomorphic to the one we will analyze.
We consider a U(1) gauge theory with two chiral superfields Ai , i = 1, 2 of
charge 1 and two chiral superfields Bj , j = 1, 2, of charge −1. We can think of
them as coordinates on V ∼
= C4 . We take the superpotential to be zero. The
ordinary potential energy for the bosonic components is (at σ = 0)

j

The U(1) action on V is
ai → λai
bj → λ−1 bj

(5.38)

with λ ∈ U(1); it can be extended to a C∗ action by permitting λ ∈ C∗ .
The low energy effective space-time is obtained as usual by setting U = 0 and
dividing by U(1); it is in other words V //U(1), the symplectic quotient of V by
67

U(1) in the language of §4. There are really three possible symplectic quotients,
corresponding to r > 0, r = 0, and r < 0. We will call them Z+ , Z0 , and Z− .

Z+ , Z0 , and Z− are all birationally isomorphic in their natural complex structures according to the arguments of §4. In fact, let Ve be the region of V in which

the ai are not both zero, and the bj are not both zero. Then by precisely the
arguments of §4, the symplectic quotient Ve //U(1) can be naturally identified – for
any r – with the holomorphic quotient Ve /C∗ . Z+ , Z0 , and Z− are partial compactifications of Ve /C∗ obtained by including contributions of some of the bad C∗

orbits on which a1 = a2 = 0 or b1 = b1 = 0. In fact, these bad orbits are of three
types: the origin O with ai = bj = 0; the set V1 of orbits with bj = 0 but the ai
not both zero; and the set V2 of orbits with ai = 0 but the bj not both zero.

By including the appropriate bad orbits, Z+ , Z0 , and Z− can be described as
follows:
(i) For r > 0, the C∗ orbits that do not contain zeros of D are the orbits in O
and V2 . Other C∗ orbits (whether in Ve or V1 ) each contribute precisely one point
to the symplectic quotient Z+ . Hence Z+ = (Ve ∪ V1 )/C∗ . Here Ve ∪ V1 is precisely

the region in V in which the ai are not both zero. The values of the ai , up to
scaling by C∗ , determine a point in a copy of CP1 which we will call CP1a . Z+ is

fibered over CP1a by forgetting the values of the bj ; since the values of the bj are
arbitrary, the fiber is a copy of C2 . The zero section of Z+ → CP1a , that is the locus

b1 = b2 = 0, is a genus zero holomorphic curve, in fact an embedding CP1a ⊂ Z+ .

We henceforth identify CP1a with its image under this embedding. For bj = 0,
P
vanishing of D gives i |ai |2 = r, so the Kahler form of CP1a is proportional to r.
(ii) For r = 0, the only bad C∗ orbit that contributes is O; it contributes a

single point to Z0 , and that point is a singularity. We will examine the singularity
more closely later.
(iii) The structure for r < 0 is similar to that for r > 0 with the roles of ai and
bj reversed. In particular, Z− = (Ve ∪ V2 )/C∗ . Here Ve ∪ V2 is the region of V in

which the bj are not both zero. The values of the bj determine a point in a copy
68

of CP1 that we will call CP1b . Z− is fibered over CP1b with fiber a copy of C2
parametrized by the valued of the ai . The zero section a1 = a2 = 0 of Z− → CP1b

gives a genus zero curve in Z− which is an embedding CP1b ⊂ Z− . This curve –

which we identify with CP1b – has Kahler form proportional to −r.

Z+ , Z0 , and Z− are all non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. Indeed, the holomorphic four-form Θ = da1 ∧ da2 ∧ db1 ∧ db2 on V is C∗ invariant (because
P
∗
i Qi = 0); contracting it with the vector field generating the C action gives

an everywhere non-zero holomorphic three form whose restriction to the appropriate region of V is the pullback of a holomorphic volume form on Z+ , Z0 , or
Z− .
In passing from r > 0 to r < 0, a change in topology occurs. CP1a shrinks
to zero size as r → 0 from above, and is replaced by CP1b for r < 0. Classically

the interpolation from r > 0 to r < 0 passes through a singularity at r = 0, but
according to the argument of §3.2, there is no such singularity in the sigma model
as long as the θ angle is generic. We have achieved the promised smooth change
in topology in sigma models of (non-compact) Calabi-Yau manifolds.
It is true that (by exchanging the a’s and b’s), Z+ and Z− are actually isomorphic. However, in a global situation, with our discussion applied to a portion of
some compact Calabi-Yau manifold, the replacement of Z+ by Z− or of CP1a by
CP1b entails a change in the topology of space-time.
To give a new perspective on the model, let us now consider more closely the
nature of the singularity at the origin of the exceptional symplectic quotient Z0 .
Let x, y, z, and t be coordinates on a copy of C4 that we will call W . The
formulas
x =a1 b1
y =a2 b2
z =a1 b2
t =a2 b1 .
69

(5.39)

give a C∗ invariant map V → W . By restricting these formulas to Ve ∪ O and
dividing by C∗ , we get a map from Z0 → W . (By starting with Ve ∪ V1 or Ve ∪ V2

we would get maps Z± → W .) It is evident that the image of Z0 in W lies in the
affine quadric Q defined by

xy − zt = 0.

(5.40)

In fact, the map defined in (5.39) is an isomorphism between Z0 and Q.
This assertion can be justified as follows:
(a) To prove that the map is surjective, we must show that if x, y, z, and t obey
(5.40), then (5.39) is satisfied for some values of ai , bj . If x = y = z = t = 0, we
take ai = bj = 0. If, say, x 6= 0, we pick a1 = 1 and then iteratively solve (5.39)
for a2 , b1 , b2 .

(b) To prove that the map is injective, we must show that if x, y, z, and t
obey (5.40), then (5.39) determines the ai , bj uniquely up to the action of C∗ . If
x = y = z = t = 0, then (5.39) requires that either the ai or the bj are both zero.
But in that case, for ai and bj to define a point in Z0 , they must all be zero, so
x = y = z = t = 0 is the image only of the point O ∈ Z0 . Otherwise, if say x 6= 0,
then (5.39) requires a1 6= 0. We can use the C∗ action to set a1 = 1, and then

(5.39) uniquely determines a2 , b1 , b2 . This completes the proof of isomorphism of
Z0 and Q.
The singularity of Q at x = y = z = t = 0 is the simplest type of isolated
singularity of a three dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold (see [41], p. 121). This
singularity can be resolved by blowing up the origin in Q, but that would ruin the
Calabi-Yau condition. There are two minimal ways to resolve the singularity of
Q while preserving the Calabi-Yau condition. The two choices are to replace the
singular point by a copy of CP1 which should be either CP1a or CP1b as constructed
above. Thus the two “small resolutions” of Q as a Calabi-Yau manifold are precisely
Z+ and Z− . The topology-changing transition that we found above was a transition
between these two small resolutions.
70

The Instanton Sum
To get more insight, we want to study the behavior of physical observables
in the transition from Z+ to Z− , or more exactly from X+ to X− where X±
are compact Calabi-Yau manifolds that coincide outside of a region (or perhaps
finitely many similar regions) where they look like Z± . The simplest physical
observables to analyze are low energy Yukawa couplings. Yukawa couplings of
massless multiplets derived from H 2,1 (X± ) are independent of r and so should be
invariant under the transition from X+ to X− . Of more interest are the Yukawa
couplings of massless multiplets associated with H 1,1 (X± ). These are determined
by complicated instanton sums; we want to see what happens to those sums in
interpolating from r > 0 to r < 0.
Writing down the full instanton sums on X± would require very detailed information about the rational curves. Comparing the instantons of X± is much easier.
All that happens in the transition from X+ to X− is that one genus zero curve,
called CP1a above, is lost, and replaced by another genus zero curve, above called
CP1b . Our problem is simply to evaluate the contributions for r > 0 from CP1a
and its multiple covers, and compare to the contributions for r < 0 from CP1b and
its multiple covers.
First of all, if H 2,0 (X± ) = 0 (as for almost all Calabi-Yau manifolds), then
H 1,1 (X± ) can be identified with the group of divisors on X± , up to linear equivalence. Moreover, as X+ and X− differ only in complex codimension two, divisors
on X+ can be naturally identified with divisors on X− . This gives a natural isomorphism between the groups H 1,1 (X± ), which we will therefore call simply H 1,1 (X).
It may appear that we need some detailed information about H 1,1 (X), but
happily that is not so. If E1 , E2 , and E3 are three divisors, the contribution of a
rational curve C to the corresponding Yukawa coupling is proportional to
(C, E1 )(C, E2)(C, E3 )

(5.41)

where (C, E) is the intersection number of the curve C and the divisor E. Therefore
71

CP1a and CP1b and their covers contribute only to Yukawa couplings of states
associated with divisors that they meet. This means that any divisor which, up to
linear equivalence, can be chosen not to intersect CP1a and CP1b is not sensitive to
the interpolation from X+ to X− . We therefore need not understand the divisor
classes of X± ; it is enough to understand the divisor classes of Z± or equivalently
of Z0 .
The divisor class group of Z0 is calculated in Hartshorne’s book [45], example
II.6.6.1 and exercise II.6.5. The result is that any divisor on Z0 (or Z± ) is a multiple
of the divisor E given by a1 = 0. (Not being C∗ invariant, a1 is a section of a line
bundle rather than a function, so the fact that E is the divisor of a1 does not make
it trivial.) For example, the divisor E ′ given by b1 = 0 obeys
E + E′ = 0

(5.42)

since the product a1 b1 = x is a function on Z0 , and E + E ′ is the divisor of this
function.
Therefore, the only Yukawa coupling that we need to evaluate is the three point
function of the multiplet associated with E. To evaluate the contributions of CP1a
and CP1b to this three point coupling, we need to know their intersection number
with E. Indeed,
(CP1a , E) = 1,

(5.43)

since CP1a and E meet transversely in one point (represented on V by the C∗ orbit
a1 = b1 = b2 = 0, a2 6= 0). Likewise (CP1b , E ′ ) = 1, and in view of (5.42), it follows

that

(CP1b , E) = −1.

(5.44)

(E and CP1b do not meet transversely, so this number cannot be determined by
just counting intersection points.)
72

Apart from these intersection numbers, to evaluate the instanton sums we
need to know the instanton action, which for an instanton C contributes a factor
R
exp(2πiτ ), where −2πiτ = C ω; here ω is a two form representing a complexified

Kahler form on X (its real part is the ordinary Kahler form, and its imaginary part
R
R
incorporates the θ angle). We therefore need −2πita = CP1a ω, −2πitb = CP1 ω.
b

Because every divisor is locally equivalent to a multiple of E, we can assume that
ω is a multiple of the Poincaré dual of E (plus terms that do not contribute to ta
or tb ). In view of (5.43) and (5.44) we get therefore the important result

tb = −ta .

(5.45)

We will now compute on X± the Yukawa coupling of three fields associated
with the divisor E. We will do the calculation as a function of ta or equivalently
tb . In the calculation on X+ , the physical region is Im ta > 0, since if the curve
CP1a is to exist, as it does on X+ , it must have positive area. The physical region
for the calculation on X− is likewise Im tb > 0 or equivalently Im ta < 0. What we
want to do is to compute the instanton sum on X+ for Im ta > 0 and compare its
analytic continuation to the instanton sum on X− for Im ta < 0.
The actual computation is not difficult. On X+ , we have to take account of
CP1a and its multiple covers. Using the basic formula for the instanton contribution [46] and the formula for the contributions of multiple covers conjectured by
Candelas et. al. [47] and justified by Aspinwall and Morrison [48], the contribution
of CP1a and its multiple covers to the Yukawa coupling is

λ+ = (CP1a , E)3

∞

(5.46)

The nth term is the contribution of the nth cover of CP1a ; the series converges for
Im ta > 0.
73

On X− , we have to likewise take account of CP1b and its covers. The formula
analogous to (5.46) (convergent now for Im ta < 0) is
λ− = (CP1b , E)3

∞

(5.47)

One might naively think that the hypothesis of smooth continuation from X+
to X− should mean that λ+ = λ− , but in fact according to the above formulas
λ+ − λ− = −1.

(5.48)

The discrepancy has a natural interpretation, however. In addition to the instanton
sums, the Yukawa couplings receive a constant “classical” contribution from the
intersection pairings of X+ and X− . The birationally equivalent manifolds X+ and
X− have different cohomology rings and different intersection pairings. It must be
the case that the difference in intersection pairings between X+ and X− is +1,
cancelling (5.48).
This is easy to verify. Instead of comparing the triple intersection number
(E, E, E), we can just as well look at (E, E ′ , E ′ ), since restricted to V± , E ′ = −E.

The difference in the classical intersection pairing between X+ and X− can be
measured by counting intersections in V+ and V− . We have to be careful, though,
to use the same representatives for E, E ′ , E ′ in V+ as in V− ; if the divisors are
shifted by linear equivalence, the number of intersections outside of V± might

change. So we represent E by a1 = 0 and the two copies of E ′ by b1 = 0 and
b2 = 0. In V+ , these divisors meet transversely at the one point a1 = b1 = b2 = 0,
so the intersection number is +1. In V− , b1 and b2 never both vanish, so the
intersection number is 0. So we get the expected excess intersection number in X+
relative to X− of +1.
So the Yukawa couplings on X− are analytic continuations of those of X+ ,
as expected. Moreover, the fact that (5.46) and (5.47) have a pole at ta = 0 as
74

their only singularity is in accord with the argument of §3.2 according to which r

and θ (essentially the imaginary and real parts of ta ) must both vanish to get a
singularity.

6. EXTENSION TO (0, 2) MODELS
Models with (0, 2) supersymmetry (that is, two right-moving and no leftmoving supersymmetries, as opposed to the (2, 2) models studied above) are important phenomenologically. In the context of compactification of string theory
to four dimensions, they lead naturally to SU(5) or SO(10) rather than E6 as effective the grand unified gauge group. These models have the reputation of being
much harder to study than (2, 2) models, because the analogs of the Gepner soluble
models, the Landau-Ginzburg correspondence, etc., have not been known. In this
section we will construct the (0, 2) version of the Landau-Ginzburg correspondence.
This is a straightforward matter of working out the structure of the appropriate
(0, 2) superfields and then repeating the procedure of §3.
6.1. (0, 2) Superfields
We will work in (0, 2) superspace, with bosonic coordinates y α , α = 1, 2, and

which are used in constructing Lagrangians.
I make no claim to describing here all possible (0, 2) models, only those that
can be conveniently described by certain types of (0, 2) superfields.
The Gauge Multiplet
We want to introduce gauge fields in superspace. The gauge covariant derivatives will be called D+ , D + , and Dα = D/Dy α. We assume the constraints on the

superspace gauge fields

D+ 2 = D + 2 = 0
D+ D + + D + D+ = 2i(D0 + D1 ).

(6.3)

(These equations, for instance, permit the existence of the (0, 2) chiral superfields
that we introduce later.) The first two equations mean that
D+ = e−Ψ D+ eΨ

D+ = eΨ D+ e−Ψ ,

(6.4)

with Ψ a Lie algebra valued function. By a gauge transformation one can assume
that Ψ is real. One can also gauge away terms in Ψ that are independent of θ+
+

or of θ . In particular, one can go to an analog of Wess-Zumino gauge in which
Ψ = θ+ θ+ (v0 + v1 ), with v0 + v1 a function of the y α only. With this partial gauge
fixing,
D0 + D1 = ∂0 + ∂1 + i(v0 + v1 )

D+ = + − iθ (D0 + D1 )

D + = − + + iθ+ (D0 + D1 ).

(6.5)

The rest of the superspace gauge field is
D0 − D1 = ∂0 − ∂1 + iV,
76

(6.6)

with some function V that can be expanded
+

+

V = v0 − v1 − 2iθ+ λ− − 2iθ λ− + 2θ+ θ D.

(6.7)

The transformation laws of vα , λ− , λ− , and D can be deduced from these formulas
(using the supersymmetry generators (6.2) accompanied by gauge transformations
to preserve the form of (6.5)) and are precisely the (0, 2) truncation of the transformation laws (2.12) of the (2, 2) gauge multiplet – except that some fields are
missing. The missing fields form a separate (0, 2) multiplet that will be identified
later.
The basic gauge invariant field strength is Υ = [D + , D0 − D1 ]. The natural

The Chiral Multiplet
There are two types of matter multiplets to consider. One is a bose field Φ, in
some representation of the gauge group, obeying
D + Φ = 0.

We will call this the (0, 2) chiral multiplet. The chiral multiplet has a θ expansion

The Fermi Multiplet
The other type of matter multiplet is an anticommuting, negative chirality

D + Λ− =

(6.13)

where E is some superfield obeying

where . . . is some anticommuting superfield annihilated by D + . These terms, which

The (0, 2) analog of the C.Y./L.G. correspondence will be found – in a by now
familiar fashion – by studying the vacuum structure as a function of r.
Reduction Of (2, 2) Multiplets
Now let us discuss the reduction of (2, 2) multiplets to (0, 2) multiplets.
First, consider the (2, 2) gauge multiplet, described in Wess-Zumino gauge by
±

a scalar function V (y, θ± , θ ) with the expansion of equation (2.11). Part of this
multiplet makes up the (0, 2) gauge multiplet described above. The remaining fields
are σ, λ+ , and λ+ , and make up a (0, 2) chiral multiplet. In fact, this multiplet is
simply Σ′ = Σ|θ− =θ− =0 , where Σ = σ + . . . is the gauge invariant field strength of
⋆

the (2, 2) gauge multiplet, introduced in equation (2.15).

Now consider a (2, 2) chiral multiplet Φ. Φ decomposes under (0, 2) supersymmetry into two multiplets. First, there is a (0, 2) chiral multiplet
Φ′ = Φ|θ− =θ− =0 .

(6.28)

⋆ To put the θ expansion of Σ′ in the standard form (6.11) for a (0, 2) chiral multiplet, one
must absorb a factor of i in λ+ .
80

Second, let
1
Λ− = √ D− Φ|θ− =θ− =0 .
2

(6.29)

1
D+ Λ− = √ {D + , D− }Φ θ− =θ− =0 .
2

(6.30)

Then

If, for instance, the gauge group is U(1), and Φ is of charge Q, this amounts to
D+ Λ− = 2iQΣ′ Φ′ .

(6.31)

√
E = iQ 2Σ′ Φ′ .

(6.32)

So Λ− is a fermi multiplet with

Finally, we want the (0, 2) reduction of the superpotential of a (2, 2) model.
Consider a (2, 2) model with chiral superfields Φi and a superpotential W (Φi ).
Under (0, 2) supersymmetry, the Φi split, as we have just seen, into (0, 2) chiral
√
superfields Φ′i , and fermi superfields Λ−,i . The latter obey D+ Λ−,i = 2Ei , where
from (6.32),

√
Ei = iQi 2Σ′ Φ′i .

(6.33)

While in (2, 2) supersymmetry the scalar and Yukawa couplings of chiral superfields
are determined by a single function W , in (0, 2) supersymmetry we must specify
a collection of functions J i , one for each Λ−,i , obeying J i Ei = 0, with Ei given
above. The J i that arise in reduction of a (2, 2) model are simply
Ji =

∂W
.
∂Φ′i

(6.34)

This can be found by comparing equation (2.21) for couplings derived from a
superpotential in (2, 2) models to equation (6.25) for the couplings determined by
the J’s. With J i as in (6.34) and Ei as in (6.33) the equation Ei J i = 0 is a
consequence of the gauge invariance of W .
81

6.2. Some Models
Now, let us apply this machinery to some sigma models with (0, 2) supersymmetry. For simplicity, we will consider only the case in which the target space is a
hypersurface X in CPn−1 .
We know from §3 which superfields we need to construct a super-renormalizable

(2, 2) model flowing at low energies to the sigma model of X. For our present

purposes, we must decompose those superfields into (0, 2) multiplets, with a view
to eventually constructing (0, 2) deformations of the models of §3 – and their
Landau-Ginzburg description.

So we consider a U(1) gauge theory in (0, 2) superspace, with the following
⋆

(0, 2) chiral multiplets: n fields Si of charge 1, one field P of charge −n, and one

neutral field Σ (from the reduction of the (2, 2) gauge multiplet). In addition, we
want n fermi multiplets Λ−,i , of charge 1, with
√
Ei = i 2ΣSi ,

(6.35)

and one more fermi multiplet Λ−,0 , of charge −n, with
√
E0 = −in 2ΣP.

(6.36)

To complete the specification of the model, we need to pick additional functions
J i , i = 1 . . . n, and J 0 , with
Ei J i + E0 J 0 = 0.

(6.37)

In the (2, 2) case, we had the superpotential W = P G(Si ), with G a homogeneous
nth order polynomial obeying the usual transversality condition. In (0, 2) language,
⋆ All supermultiplets here will be (0, 2) supermultiplets, and I omit the primes from the
notation.
82

this choice according to (6.34) leads to
∂G
∂Si
0
J = G.
Ji = P

(6.38)

To obtain (0, 2) models, we will change these choices while preserving (6.37) as well
as gauge invariance. We will also assume that J 0 remains independent of P while J i
remains linear in P . (Other terms allowed by gauge invariance would be of higher
order in the chiral superfields and apparently “irrelevant” in the renormalization
group sense. The same is true of possible modifications of the E’s.) So we may as
well preserve J 0 = G as the definition of G. It is however possible to change the
J i . The general possibility is
∂G
+ P Gi
∂Si
0
J = G,
Ji = P

(6.39)

where the Gi are polynomials of degree n − 1 in the Sk chosen so that
Si Gi = 0.

(6.40)

So we obtain a family of (0, 2) models parametrized, in addition to the usual
data, by the Gi . Pulling together the relevant formulas, the potential energy of
the theory is

(6.41)

Here the bosonic components of Si , P , and Σ have been called si , p, and σ. We can
therefore analyze the r dependence just as in the (2, 2) case. For r >> 0 we get
a phase in which the low energy theory is a (0, 2) sigma model with target space
X. For r << 0, we get a (0, 2) Landau-Ginzburg phase. We have generalized the
C-Y/L-G correspondence to (0, 2) models. Let us look at the two phases more
closely.
83

!

The Landau-Ginzburg Phase
For r << 0, p gets an expectation value, just as in the (2, 2) case, breaking the
gauge group to Zn . The model is therefore a Zn orbifold.
The massless multiplets are the chiral multiplets Si and Λ−,i ; other multiplets
are massive. The effective values of Ei and J i in the low energy theory are obtained
p
by setting σ and p to their vacuum expectation values, namely 0 and −r/n. So
one has in the effective (0, 2) Landau-Ginzburg model
Ei = 0

(6.42)

Of course these obey Ei J i = 0.
The Calabi-Yau Phase
For r >> 0 the massless bose modes are the modes tangent to X. The rightmoving massless fermions are just the (0, 2) partners of the massless bosons.
But what about left-moving massless fermions? Here the situation is more
interesting. The fermi component of Λ−,0 is massive, but certain modes of λ−,i
(the fermi components of the superfields Λ−,i ) are massless. By inspection of the
above formulas for the Lagrangian, the massless modes can be seen to obey

and also

λ−,i = 0.

Let us put these formulas in the general format of (0, 2) sigma models. In general, massless left-moving fermions are sections of some holomorphic vector bundle
F over the target space X. This means that it must be possible to describe the
84

massless modes by equations that vary holomorphically in the si . Now, (6.44) is
holomorphic in si , but (6.43) is not. To achieve more understanding, we should
replace (6.43) by an equation that has the same consequences but varies holomorphically in s. This is easily done. Instead of the constraint (6.43), introduce a
gauge invariance, saying that two modes of λi are considered equivalent if they are
related by a transformation
λi → λi + si λ,

(6.45)

for some λ. Then (6.43) can be regarded as a gauge fixing condition; each orbit of
the invariance (6.45) has a unique representative obeying (6.43).
To put (6.45) and (6.44) in their theoretical context, introduce the usual line
bundles O(k) over CPn−1 , restricted to X, and consider a sequence of maps of

vector bundles over X,

β
α ⊕n O(1)−→O(n)

(6.46)

with α being the map λ → si λ, and β the map
λi → λi



(6.47)

(6.46) is a complex of vector bundles (that is βα = 0), but it is not an exact
sequence. On the contrary, ker β/im α is a rank n − 2 holomorphic vector bundle

F over X.

For Gi = 0, F reduces to the tangent bundle T X of X. In general, F is
a deformation of T X, and conversely, all deformations of T X as a holomorphic
vector bundle over X can be described as in (6.46). This family of deformations
of T X has been discussed previously [52, volume II, pp. 461-3]. The choice of F
(together with the rest of the data) determines a (0, 2) model with target X, so
the Gi parametrize a family of such models; we have found the Landau-Ginzburg
description of that family.
85

One may wonder what concrete results follow from this (0, 2) analog of the usual
C-Y/L-G correspondence. One answer, along the lines of §3.3, is that Tr(−1)F and
the elliptic genus are invariant under the transition from Calabi-Yau to LandauGinzburg models, while for the half-twisted (0, 2) model (which determines low
energy Yukawa couplings) Landau-Ginzburg is an analytic continuation of CalabiYau. (The A and B topological field theories do not have (0, 2) analogs.) Another
answer, along the lines of §5.5, is that topology-changing processes involving (0, 2)

models can be analyzed just as for (2, 2) models.

To complete the story, perhaps I should point out that in (0, 2) sigma models
with left-moving massless fermions taking values in some vector bundle F over
the target space X, the objects Ea and J a are geometrically to be understood as
holomorphic sections of F and of F ∗ (the dual of F ), respectively. If non-zero,
these sections give masses to some of the modes. In the particular example we
have been studying with X a hypersurface in CPn−1 and F as above, the effective
Ea and J a are 0. They could hardly be otherwise, as in these examples F and F ∗
have no non-zero global holomorphic sections. But in the general study of (0, 2)
sigma models, when F is such that F or F ∗ have global sections, the consideration
of Ea and J a is likely to be of great importance.
Conformal Invariance?
In §3, we constructed the C-Y/L-G correspondence for (2, 2) models without

having to know whether conformal invariance is valid on either side. In the present
section, we have done the same for (0, 2) models.

For the (0, 2) models, the situation is believed to be quite different from that
for (2, 2) models. The (2, 2) models studied in §3 are all believed to have confor-

mally invariant fixed points to which they flow in the infrared. Order by order in
perturbation theory, the same is true for the (0, 2) models analyzed above. But
in many cases, these approximate (0, 2) conformal fixed points are destabilized by
nonperturbative corrections [46,53]. For instance, for the particular case we have
been looking at closely, it is believed that this occurs for generic choices of the
86

polynomials G, Gi . Little is understand, from the world-sheet point of view, about
the nature of the breakdown of conformal invariance.
We have, for illustrative purposes, studied in detail only (0, 2) models that can
be constructed as perturbations of (2, 2) models. It would be extremely interesting
to study other (0, 2) models using the techniques in this paper.
