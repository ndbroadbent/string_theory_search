We describe a method for finding flux vacua of type IIB string theory in which the Gukov-VafaWitten superpotential is exponentially small. We present an example with W0 ≈ 2 × 10−8 on an
orientifold of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface with (h1,1 , h2,1 ) = (2, 272), at large complex structure and
weak string coupling.

INTRODUCTION

To understand the nature of dark energy in quantum
gravity, one can study de Sitter solutions of string theory.
Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, and Trivedi (KKLT) have argued that there exist de Sitter vacua in compactifications
on Calabi-Yau (CY) orientifolds of type IIB string theory
[1]. An essential component of the KKLT scenario is a
small vacuum value of the classical Gukov-Vafa-Witten
[2] flux superpotential,

In §2 we present a general method for constructing
vacua with small W0 at large complex structure (LCS)
and weak string coupling, building on [9, 10]. In §3 we
give an explicit example1 where W0 ≈ 2 × 10−8 , in an
orientifold of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in CP[1,1,1,6,9] .
In §4 we show that our result accords well with the statistical predictions of [4]. We show in §5 that at least one
complex structure modulus in our example is as light as
the Kähler moduli. We explain why this feature occurs in
our class of solutions, and we comment on Kähler moduli
stabilization in our vacuum.

X

Here X is the CY orientifold, G is the three-form flux,
Ω is the (3, 0) form on X, K is the Kähler potential for
the complex structure moduli and the axiodilaton, and
the brackets denote evaluation on the vacuum expectation values of these moduli. The stabilized values of the
Kähler moduli are proportional to log(|W0 |−1 ), so control of the α0 expansion is possible only if |W0 | is very
small.
String compactifications are characterized by discrete
data, including the topology of the internal space, and
quantized fluxes within it. The number of distinct choices
is vast, and although |W0 |  1 is evidently not typical,
strong evidence for the existence of vacua with |W0 |  1
comes from the statistical treatment of [3–7], as reviewed
in [8]. By approximating the integrally-quantized fluxes
by continuous variables, one can compute the expected
number of flux vacua with |W0 | ≤ δ, for δ some chosen
threshold. This approach predicts that in an orientifold
with a sufficiently large value of the D3-brane charge tadpole QD3 there should exist choices of flux giving vacua
with exponentially small |W0 |.
We are not aware of any flaw in this statistical approach, but one can nevertheless ask: do there in fact
exist orientifolds and choices of flux giving vacua with
|W0 |  1, as the statistical theory predicts? In this Letter we answer this question in the affirmative.

Vacua with |W0 |  1 are rare elements in a large
landscape. It is therefore impractical to exhibit vacua
with |W0 |  1 by enumerating general vacua on a massive scale and filtering out the desired ones. Instead one
should pursue algorithms that preferentially find fluxes
that lead to vacua with small |W0 |.
One algorithm of this sort2 [9, 10] proceeds by finding
quantized fluxes that solve an approximate form of the
F-term equations, with the corresponding approximate
superpotential exactly vanishing, at some given point U?
in moduli space. One then solves for nearby moduli values U = U? + δU that solve the true F-term equations
with the same choice of fluxes. When the approximation
made in the first step is a good one, the true superpotential evaluated at U = U? + δU will be small.
We will construct a class of flux vacua along these lines.
The approximate superpotential is obtained by neglecting nonperturbative corrections to the prepotential for
the complex structure moduli around the LCS locus in
moduli space.3 Stabilization near LCS, where these nonperturbative terms are exponentially small, then yields
an exponentially small flux superpotential.

A LANDSCAPE OF WEAKLY COUPLED
FLUX VACUA WITH SMALL W0

Issues related to the size of |W0 | are discussed in e.g. [12, 13].

We consider an orientifold X of a Calabi-Yau threefold with −QD3 units of D3-brane charge on seven-branes
and O3-planes. Let {Aa , B b } be a symplectic basis for
H3 (X, Z), with Aa ∩ Ab = 0, Aa ∩ B b = δab , and
B a ∩ B b = 0. We use projective coordinates {U a } on the
complex structure moduli space of dimension n ≡ h2,1
− ,
and we work in a gauge in which U 0 = 1. Denoting the
prepotential by F and writing Fa = ∂U a F, we define the

Consider a choice of fluxes and moduli values that

Because Wpert is homogeneous, there is a

where we have chosen the axiodilaton τ as a coordinate
along the flat valley. As the inner product p~·~q need not be
integer, it is possible to find flux quanta such that τ can
be stabilized at weak coupling, by realizing a racetrack.5

4 We have set the reduced Planck mass to unity, and we omit here

the Kähler potential
for the Kähler moduli, which reads KK =

−3 log 2 Vol2/3 , with Vol the volume of X in ten-dimensional
Einstein frame, in units of (2π)2 α0 . Our conventions match those
of [18] upon taking V = 1/4π and b = 1 in §A.3 of [18], cf. [11].

5 Achieving racetrack stabilization within our class of models could

aid in the search for large axion decay constants via alignment,
as in [23]. See [24–26] for approaches using shift symmetries: in
particular, [26] also employs a superpotential of degree two.

3
This works efficiently if the two most relevant instantons,
which we label as ~q1 and ~q2 , satisfy p~ · q~1 ≈ p~ · q~2 .

AN EXAMPLE

We now illustrate our method in an explicit example,
with n = 2. We consider the degree 18 hypersurface
in weighted projective space CP[1,1,1,6,9] studied in [27].
This is a CY with 272 complex structure moduli, but as
explained in [9], it is useful to study a particular locus
in moduli space where the CY becomes invariant under
a G = Z6 × Z18 discrete symmetry.6 By turning on only
flux quanta invariant under G, we are guaranteed to find
solutions of the full set of F-term equations, by solving
only those corresponding to the directions tangent to the
invariant subspace. Conveniently, the periods in these
directions are identical to the periods of the mirror CY,
and are obtained from an effective two-moduli prepotential as in (6) with the data

6 If we were to orbifold by this symmetry group and resolve the

singularities we would obtain the mirror CY [28]. We will not
proceed in this direction, but instead stay with the original CY.

A systematic understanding of statistical predictions
of the flux landscape was developed in [3–7], in part by
approximating the integer fluxes by continuous variables.
Let us compare our result (20) with the statistical prediction for the smallest possible W0 in our orientifold.
We write N (λ∗ , QD3 ) for the expected number of vacua
with D3-brane charge in fluxes less than QD3 and with
|W0 |2 ≤ λ∗  1. According to [4], N (λ∗ , QD3 ) is given

the smallest value of |W0 | expected to exist is of order
6 × 10−7 , which agrees reasonably well with (20).

TOWARD STABILIZING ALL MODULI

Thus far we have found a class of no-scale vacua in
which the complex structure moduli and axiodilaton Fterms vanish, and W0 is exponentially small. To achieve
stabilization of the Kähler moduli from this promising
starting point, two issues must be addressed: the masses
of the complex structure moduli and axiodilaton, and the
nonperturbative superpotential for the Kähler moduli.
For the example of §3, we have computed the mass matrix along the G-symmetric locus. Two of the moduli are
heavy, but the third, corresponding to the perturbativelyflat direction τ , has a mass proportional to |W0 |. We are
not aware of a reason why any of the G-breaking combinations should be comparably light, but checking this
directly will be important, and rather challenging. Assuming that the G-breaking moduli are indeed heavy, the
low energy theory describing Kähler moduli stabilization
will include τ and the Kähler moduli T1 , T2 . (Kähler
moduli stabilization in a related setting has been discussed in [30].)
Provided that the seven-brane stacks wrap divisors
that are either rigid [31], or else are rigidified by the introduction of fluxes [32–34], we expect a nonperturbative
superpotential of the form

tions, one should then be able to treat B and C as constants. Verifying this directly would be informative.
To exhibit vacua with all moduli stabilized in this setting, one should establish (22) and compute B and C for
a seven-brane configuration in which c1 and c2 are sufficiently large to ensure control of the α0 expansion. This
worthy goal is beyond the scope of the present work.

CONCLUSIONS

We have described a method for constructing flux
vacua with exponentially small Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential in compactifications of type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds, at weak string coupling
and large complex structure. The first step is to neglect nonperturbative terms in the prepotential expanded
around large complex structure, and find quantized fluxes
that at this level yield vanishing F-terms and vanishing
superpotential along a flat direction in the complex structure and axiodilaton moduli space. We provided simple
and constructive sufficient conditions for the existence of
such solutions, and we determined the flat direction analytically, vastly simplifying the search for vacua. Upon
restoring the nonperturbative corrections, one can find
full solutions in which the flat direction is lifted, although
it remains anomalously light, and the flux superpotential
is exponentially small.
We gave an explicit example with |W0 | ≈ 2×10−8 in an
orientifold of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface in CP[1,1,1,6,9] .
This value of |W0 | accords well with the statistical expectation derived from the work of Denef and Douglas
[4]. Stabilizing the Kähler moduli in this class of vacua,
and then pursuing more explicit de Sitter solutions, are
important tasks for the future.

Here A and c are known coefficients, cf. (17), and c1 and
c2 are the dual Coxeter numbers of the confining sevenbrane gauge groups. The unbroken discrete shift symmetry implies that the Pfaffian prefactors B and C can be
expanded in appropriate powers of e2πiτ . Provided that
there exists an interpolation to a weakly curved type IIA
description, these powers should be nonnegative, because
the objects that break the continuous shift symmetry
to a discrete one are type IIB D(-1)-brane instantons,
and worldsheet instantons of the type IIA mirror, which
are negligible at small string coupling and large complex
structure. By neglecting the exponentially small correc-
