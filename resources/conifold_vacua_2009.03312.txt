Introduction

In order to understand the cosmologies that are possible in quantum gravity, one can
search for de Sitter solutions in compactifications of string theory. Kachru, Kallosh, Linde,
and Trivedi (KKLT) famously proposed that orientifold compactifications of type IIB string
theory that contain specific ‘components’ in the right proportions will admit parametrically
controlled de Sitter vacua [1].
These components — a small classical flux superpotential [2–5], a warped throat region [6–11], a potential for the Kähler moduli from Euclidean D3-branes or strong gauge
dynamics [12–23], and a supersymmetry-breaking sector from anti-D3-branes [24–31] —
are by now rather well understood separately. A remaining challenge in the pursuit of
explicit examples of KKLT de Sitter vacua is to exhibit Calabi-Yau orientifolds that contain all these components at once, through calculations in which corrections to the leading
approximations are demonstrably well-controlled.
In this work we present a method for finding flux vacua that contain both a warped
throat region and an exponentially small classical flux superpotential, |W0 |  1. We do so
by building on our recent work [5], where we showed how to find flux vacua with |W0 |  1.
In [5] we took all complex structure moduli to be near large complex structure (LCS).
Warped throats, on the other hand, occur in flux vacua in which one or more complex
structure moduli are stabilized near conifold singularities — we refer to such vacua as
conifold vacua.
If the quantized fluxes threading the A-cycle and B-cycle of a conifold in such a vacuum
are sufficiently large, then the conifold region is accurately described by the warped deformed conifold supergravity solution found by Klebanov and Strassler [6], and can serve
as a setting for metastable supersymmetry breaking by anti-D3-branes [24]. In the opposite regime of small ’t Hooft coupling, the conifold region is accurately described by a
cascading gauge theory that potentially has a metastable supersymmetry-breaking state
— gauge theory vacua of this sort have been analyzed in [32–36].
In order to generalize the mechanism of [5] to include conifolds one has to overcome the
following obstacle. Introducing fluxes on the conifold cycles generates a conifold superpotential Wcf that by itself cannot be tuned to be small. Thus, the total flux superpotential
will be small in string units only if the large conifold superpotential is efficiently canceled
by a comparably large contribution Wbulk generated by fluxes on other cycles, i.e. if
|W0 | := |hWflux i| = |hWcf i + hWbulk i|  1 .
2

(1.1)

To achieve such a cancellation, one must first accurately compute the conifold superpotential Wcf in the vicinity of a conifold singularity.
In the first part of this work, we compute Wcf analytically in the case where the shrinking
3
S of the conifold is mirror dual to a shrinking curve. In such a case Wcf is obtained by
resumming the instanton corrections from string worldsheets wrapping the shrinking curve
in the mirror threefold. We then show, along the same lines as [5], that one can choose
quantized fluxes leading to an exponentially precise cancellation of the form shown in
eq. (1.1). Finally, we present explicit examples of conifold vacua in an O3/O7 orientifold
of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface X̃ with h1,1 (X̃) = 99 and h2,1 (X̃) = 3.
Let us be clear in advance about the scope of this work. We will present a mechanism
for constructing classical flux vacua in which |W0 |  1 and at least one complex structure
modulus is stabilized near a conifold, and we will illustrate the mechanism with flux vacua
of an explicit orientifold. Although a long-term goal is to combine such results with Kähler
moduli stabilization and a metastable uplift to a de Sitter solution,1 we will not take these
latter steps here. Exhibiting ensembles of flux vacua that can be lifted to metastable de
Sitter solutions is an ambitious task for the future.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2 we set our notation (§2.1), recall a
few results about the large complex structure limit in Calabi-Yau moduli space (§2.2), and
review the mechanism of [5] for constructing vacua with small flux superpotential (§2.3). In
§3 we present a mechanism for constructing conifold vacua with small flux superpotential.
To illustrate this, in §4 we examine a Calabi-Yau threefold X with h1,1 (X) = 3 and
h2,1 (X) = 99 (§4.1); construct its mirror X̃, and an orientifold thereof (§4.2); and exhibit
conifold vacua with |W0 |  1 in the orientifold of X̃ (§4.3). We conclude in §5. The
appendix contains two independent computations of the D3-brane tadpole in the orientifold
of §4.2.
Note added: Simultaneously with ours, the work [38] appeared which addresses the
same issue.

Vacua with small flux superpotential

2.1

Setup

We will work in the landscape of four-dimensional N = 1 supergravity solutions obtained
from compactifications of type IIB string theory on O3/O7 orientifolds of Calabi-Yau
threefolds. While we are ultimately interested in analyzing the full vacuum structure
of such models, arising in particular from the non-perturbative potential for the Kähler
moduli, in this paper we will neglect the Kähler moduli altogether. That is, we consider
the classical no-scale solutions of [7]. Throughout this paper, unless noted otherwise, we
will work in ten-dimensional Einstein frame in units where `2s ≡ (2π)2 α0 = 1, and use our
freedom to Weyl-rescale the four-dimensional metric to set the four-dimensional reduced
Planck mass to one. These conventions match those of [5].
To begin, we consider a Calabi-Yau threefold X̃ and a holomorphic and isometric
involution Ĩ : X̃ → X̃, with induced action on the holomorphic three-form Ω 7→ −Ω.
After the orientifolding, the fixed locus of Ĩ hosts O3-planes and O7-planes.
Let Q be the total D3-brane charge of the O3-planes and seven-brane stacks. If Q < 0
then its contribution to the D3-brane tadpole can be canceled by ND3 mobile D3-branes
as well as three-form fluxes F3 and H3 such that2

and we will write f~ = (fa , f a ), ~h = (ha , ha ).
Prior to orientifolding, the complex structure moduli come in N = 2 vector multiplets,
and the periods Fa (z) derive from a prepotential F(z) via Fa (z) = ∂a F(z). The treelevel exact Weil-Petersson metric on complex structure moduli space is obtained from the

into even and odd eigenspaces, and the complex structure moduli that survive the projec2,1
tion are counted by h2,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) := dim H− (X̃, Q) and come in N = 1 chiral multiplets.
We will denote these surviving complex structure moduli by z a , a = 1, ..., h2,1
− (X̃, Ĩ). Like1,1

h+ (X̃, Ĩ) are the number of axionic chiral multiplets and U (1) vector multiplets, respectively, but will play no role in this paper. The full tree-level effective action has been
worked out in [39].
After orientifolding, the Kähler potential of eq. (2.5) will in general receive corrections
from fluxes and orientifold planes, but these are subleading at sufficiently large volume
where fluxes are dilute and warping is negligible. The superpotential, however, is exact
up to non-perturbative corrections in the Kähler moduli and D(-1) instantons and is given
by [7, 40]

where Wnp (z, τ, T ) parameterizes non-perturbative corrections in the Kähler moduli T and

the dilaton τ , which are typically difficult to compute.3 We will neglect these corrections
self-consistently. Moreover, even when flux backreaction is severe, the vacuum solutions
Dτ W = Dza W = 0 obtained using the classical Kähler potential (2.5) are reliable as long
as the ten-dimensional geometry is in the supergravity regime, even though the scalar
potential away from the supersymmetric minimum can no longer be computed from it [7].
This fact will be particularly important for the purposes of this paper because we will
stabilize complex structure moduli near a conifold point in moduli space. In this case, for
moderate values of the overall volume modulus, in the vicinity of the (deformed) conifold
regions in the Calabi-Yau the fluxes are no longer dilute and their backreaction produces the
famous Klebanov-Strassler throats [6]. These produce an exponentially strong gravitational
redshift (warping) that is not appropriately captured by eq. (2.5) and (2.7). Nevertheless,
the Klebanov-Strassler solution falls into the class of imaginary-self-dual (ISD) solutions
of [7], and the F-term equations arising from (2.5) and (2.7) can be used as a tool to find
points in Calabi-Yau moduli space where the fluxes are indeed ISD.

2.2

The large complex structure patch

In the following, we will be interested in the large complex structure (LCS) patch of complex
structure moduli space of X̃, which is mirror dual to the large volume region of the mirror
threefold X.4 Let {Σ(2)a } be a basis of H2 (X, Z) and {Σa(4) } a dual basis of H4 (X, Z), i.e.
Σ(2)a · Σb(4) = δab . Curve classes [C] ∈ H2 (X, Z) are represented by integer vectors βaC ,

let a, b = 1, ..., h1,1 (X).

The leading order contributions come from D(-1) instantons ∼ e2πiτ as well as Euclidean D3-branes

Small flux superpotentials at large complex structure

As demonstrated in [5], one can find weakly coupled flux vacua at LCS with exponentially
small flux superpotential by making a restricted choice of fluxes. Near LCS, the flux
superpotential splits as
Wflux (z a , τ ) ≡ Wpoly (z a , τ ) + Winst (z a , τ ) ,

(2.15)

where Wpoly (z, τ ) is the flux superpotential that arises from the approximation F(z) ≈
Fpoly (z), and Winst (z, τ ) parameterizes the instanton corrections,

such that p~ is in the Kähler cone of X. For such a choice of fluxes the polynomial part of
the superpotential takes the form

Wpoly (z, τ ) ∝ Kabc M a z b z c − τ Ka z a ,
2

(2.19)

and has a supersymmetric valley ∂za Wpoly = Wpoly = 0 along the one-dimensional locus
where z a = pa τ . Generically, the orthogonal directions to the flat valley are heavy and can
be integrated out — we will verify this in explicit examples in §4.3.
As the polynomial part of the superpotential vanishes along the flat valley, the instanton
corrections to the superpotential become relevant, and serve to stabilize τ . The effective
superpotential is

In the regime where D(-1) instanton effects can be consistently neglected, one should
only retain terms in the sum with βaC pa < 1. For appropriately aligned pa and suitably
hierarchical GV invariants the above structure leads to a racetrack stabilization of τ at
weak coupling and near LCS.

3

Stabilizing near the conifold

We will now extend the construction of [5] to operate in a regime where one or more of the
moduli are away from their LCS region, and are instead exponentially close to developing
a conifold singularity.
At a conifold singularity in complex structure moduli space a collection of ncf threecycles shrink to zero size [45, 46]. Let us assume that these all lie in the same homology
class, corresponding to one of the basis elements Σ(3)a , with corresponding modulus zcf .
8

We denote the remaining moduli by zi , i.e. {z a } = {zcf , z i }. Then the dual period, which
we will denote by Fcf , takes the form
Fcf (z a ) = Fcf (z i , zcf ) =

ncf
zcf ln(zcf ) + f (z i , zcf ) ,
2πi

(3.1)

where f (z i , zcf ) is a model-dependent function. Although f (z i , zcf ) is holomorphic around
zcf = 0, it will play an important role in our discussion, because generically f (z i , 0) 6= 0.
Then, with −M units of F3 flux on the shrinking cycle and K units of H3 flux on the
dual cycle, the flux superpotential splits as [7]

same sign, this stabilizes the conifold modulus exponentially close to the singularity,

(3.4)

Upon stabilizing in this regime, one is left with codimension-three defects hosting confining
Klebanov-Strassler gauge theories if gs M  1, or with warped throats with a controlled
ten-dimensional supergravity description in the regime gs M  1 [6]. In the former case,
|zcf |1/3 is identified with the confining scale of the gauge theory, while in the latter case it
is the gravitationally redshifted Randall-Sundrum-type [47] warp factor5 eA |tip ∼ |zcf |1/3 .
For generating uplifts to de Sitter vacua by including anti-D3-branes it is natural to
consider the regime gs M & 1 where the infrared region of the throat supports metastable
supersymmetry-breaking anti-D3-brane configurations that contribute to the vacuum energy [1]. However, this restriction might well be unnecessary due to the plausible existence of a supersymmetry-breaking vacuum in the Klebanov-Strassler gauge theory, see
e.g. [32–36]. In any event, in this paper we will study classical conifold vacua in both
regimes of gs M , and defer metastable supersymmetry breaking to future work.
5
Here we assume only a moderately large Calabi-Yau volume V, i.e. |zcf |  1 and also V|zcf |2  1.
In the opposite regime of parametrically large volume such that V|zcf |2  1, there is neither a throat nor
a gauge theory but simply an everywhere weakly curved conifold region with dilute fluxes. For results on
moduli stabilization in this opposing regime, see [10].

9

After stabilizing exponentially close to the conifold singularity, the flux superpotential
reads
q
i
Wflux (z , zcf ) = π2 M f (z i , 0) + Wbulk (z i , 0) + O(zcf ) .
(3.5)
In particular, the holomorphic piece f (z a ) in the conifold period (3.1) gives an O(1) contribution to the superpotential that has to be canceled against the bulk superpotential Wbulk
to give a small flux superpotential, as alluded to in the introduction. We will now explain
how this cancellation is achieved.

3.1

The conifold prepotential from a shrinking curve

In this section we will compute the periods of X̃ analytically near certain types of conifold
points. The idea is to analytically continue the periods computed at LCS into the regime
where one of the moduli, zcf , is small and close to a conifold singularity, while the other
moduli z i stay large. Our result will take the form of a double expansion in the conifold
modulus zcf  1 and in type IIA worldsheet instantons wrapping curves in X that are not
mirror-dual to the A-cycle of the conifold.
Performing an analytic continuation from the LCS region to the conifold region generally requires knowing the instanton expansion of the prepotential in eq. (2.13) to all
orders. After all, the conifold branch cut can at best arise at the radius of convergence of
the LCS expansion. Lacking such all-orders information, one might instead determine the
prepotential to high order in the instanton expansion, and compute the Taylor coefficients
of f (z a ) in (3.1) numerically by comparing in an overlapping region where both expansions
converge, as in [10]. However, in order to demonstrate an accurate cancellation between
the bulk and conifold superpotential (1.1) by this approach, one has to reach high numerical precision. For this reason we opt instead for an analytic approach, and now lay out a
set of conditions under which we can obtain the required all-orders information.
First, let us introduce some terminology. We write M(X) for the Mori cone of X, and
we call a curve class [C] ∈ M(X) GV-nilpotent of order k0 if the genus zero GV invariants
of k[C] vanish for all k > k0 . A class that is not GV-nilpotent of order k0 for any finite k0
we call GV-potent. We define the interior cone as the closure of the real cone generated
by all GV-potent curve classes in M(X).
Comparing to eq. (2.13), one sees that the infinite tower of instanton corrections from
worldsheet instantons wrapping a GV-nilpotent curve class [C] an arbitrary number of
times are simply determined by a finite sum over polylogarithms. Therefore, if we can

lattice points are populated by nonvanishing GV invariants n0(i,j,0) . The red lattice point
is GV-nilpotent of order one, and lies outside the closure of the interior cone (bounded
by dashed purple lines). Near the origin of thePCoulomb branch z 1 → 0, one retains a
2,3
controlled expansion in e2πiz with coefficients i n0(i,j,k) . These are the GV invariants on
the Higgs branch [48], and are computable because the sum over i terminates: each row in
the figure has finite length.
find a slice in moduli space where only GV-nilpotent curve classes shrink, we only need to
analytically continue the well-known polylogarithms. The following condition (which we
will establish in the example of §4) guarantees this.
We suppose that there exists a curve Cv ∈ M(X) in the mirror threefold X that is
GV-nilpotent of order one and lies outside the closure of the cone generated by all other
curve classes in M(X) with non-vanishing GV invariants: see Figure 1. (In particular, Cv
lies outside the interior cone.) In this case, there exists a wall WCv of the Kähler cone of
X where the volume of Cv vanishes. The wall WCv is a cone itself, and asymptotically far
out in this cone the volumes of all other curves with non-vanishing GV invariants tend to
infinity. For ease of exposition we will assume that Cv is an element of our basis of curves,
so without loss of generality we can choose Cv = Σ(2)1 . We will denote the corresponding
Kähler modulus of X by zcf := z 1 . The other Kähler moduli of X will be denoted by z i
with i = 2, ..., h1,1 (X). Then, we have

[C]6=[Cv ]

Since the vanishing class [Cv ] does not appear in the instanton sum, the arguments of the
polylogarithm remain small as in the LCS regime even for small zcf . This is not quite
11

enough for a sensible expansion: for two curve classes [C] and [C 0 ] with [C] − [C 0 ] ∝ [Cv ] the
corresponding arguments of the polylogarithms become identical in the limit zcf → 0, so
the GV invariants of curve classes differing by the vanishing class are effectively summed
up in that limit.6 For the instanton expansion to remain controlled, we need that these
sums of GV invariants terminate. But this is guaranteed because our vanishing curve class
lies outside the interior cone (see Figure 1). Thus, any ray parallel to [Cv ] intersects finitely
many lattice points in the interior cone.
The remaining task is to compute F1 (zcf , z i ) := ∂zcf F(zcf , z i ). The crucial difference
compared to the Fi (zcf , z i ) is that the vanishing curve does contribute to the instanton
sum, so we need to evaluate the polylogarithm near q = 1. This is most easily done using

Provided that the singular locus zcf → 0 is in fact a conifold singularity in X̃, we may
identify Fcf (zcf , z i ) ≡ F1 (zcf , z i ). The first term in (3.8) contains the universal logarithm
of the general conifold period of eq. (3.1), as well as an infinite series of holomorphic
corrections. These corrections, together with the entire second line of eq. (3.8), constitute
the holomorphic term f (z a ) in (3.1). We can therefore compute f (z a ) to any desired
accuracy by computing the GV invariants n0C of curve classes [C] up to a sufficently high
degree.
For completeness, we note that one similarly obtains a systematic expansion of the
prepotential around the conifold locus, from which the period F0 can be computed via
6
Note that if there is a Higgs branch meeting the origin of the Coulomb branch at zcf = 0, such a
summation yields the GV invariants of the Higgs branch [48].
7
The corresponding series of instanton corrections to the period vector is thus resummed into the
perturbative one-loop correction from integrating out light hypermultiplets from wrapped D2-branes/M2branes near the origin of the Coulomb branch [43, 44, 49, 50].

In summary, we have gained the much needed analytical control over the period vector
near a special class of conifolds. For this special class the shrinking S 3 of the conifold
is mirror dual to a shrinking curve. This is a nontrivial restriction because a conifold
singularity in X̃ may be mirror dual to a shrinking curve, divisor or entire threefold X.8

Moduli stabilization in three steps

We will turn on the following subset of three-form fluxes:
f~ = (P0 , Pa , 0, M a )t ,

~h = (0, Ka , 0, 0)t .

(3.12)

Instead of splitting the superpotential into contributions from the conifold fluxes and the
bulk, we expand in the conifold modulus zcf ,

For instance the famous conifold point in the mirror quintic is mirror dual to a shrinking Calabi-Yau
threefold [53]. For more examples, see [54, 55].

and with shifted b̃a := ba + ncf δa1 /24. Note that by expanding in zcf we have absorbed
all contributions to the flux superpotential that survive in the conifold limit zcf → 0 into
the expression W (0) (z i , τ ) containing both bulk and conifold contributions. Provided that
we can stabilize the bulk moduli and the dilaton such that |hW (0) (z i , τ )i|  1, and also
stabilize zcf near the conifold, a small overall flux superpotential as in eq. (1.1) will result.

and K := K1 .

(3.18)

Given this structure, we may stabilize moduli in three essentially independent steps. First,
(0)
we use Wpoly to stabilize all but one combination of the bulk moduli and dilaton as in [5]
(0)
in a vacuum with Wpoly = 0. For that we choose integer fluxes such that
Pi = aia M a ,

P0 = b̃a M a ,

(3.19)

and
K i pi = 0 ,

0 ≤ −M a Ka ≤ 2Q ,

with pi := (Kija M a )−1 Kj ,

(3.20)

such that pi is interior to the wall of the Kähler cone of X specified by zcf = 0. In analogy
to the previous section, this stabilizes the bulk moduli along the valley z i = pi τ and indeed
(0)
Wpoly (z i = pi τ, τ ) = 0. At this stage the leading contributions to the superpotential from
the bulk and the conifold have been canceled against each other perfectly. The neglected
(0)
contributions from Winst and zcf W (1) to the F-term conditions of the directions orthogonal
to the flat valley z i = pi τ are negligible if Im(τ ) is large and the conifold modulus zcf is
14

small.
We note that the above corresponds to a Wilsonian integrating out of heavy degrees of
freedom (the orthogonal moduli), so we can stabilize the light degrees of freedom (τ, zcf )
using the low energy effective field theory. Below the mass scale of the heavy orthogonal
moduli, the effective superpotential reads

Weff (τ, zcf ) = Winst (z i = pi τ, τ ) + zcf W (1) (z i = pi τ, τ, zcf ) .

in terms of the string coupling 1/gs = Im(τ ), and with K 0 := K1 − M a K1ai pi .9 The phase
of zcf is similarly stabilized in terms of C0 = Re(τ ). As long as zcf  1 the stabilization of
zcf does not affect the stabilization of the previously integrated-out heavy moduli.
The remaining light direction τ can be stabilized as in [5] using the instanton correc(0)
tions Winst in a regime where Im(τ ) is indeed large.10 If we stabilize in a regime where
(0)
the resulting vev hWinst i is much larger than zcf W (1) then it is consistent to neglect the
contribution of zcf W (1) to the F-term of τ . The vacuum value of the full flux superpotential
is then given, up to corrections of O(zcf ), by

W0 ≈

(3.23)

We have therefore extended the mechanism of [5] to conifold vacua.
The combination K 0 /ncf appearing in eq. (3.22) is naturally interpreted as the integrated (but not
necessarily quantized) three-form field strength residing in a single throat. The presence of more than one
throat that share the same B-cycle may lead to the presence of light degrees of freedom (thraxions) that
control the relative distribution of fluxes [56] and would threaten the stability of a warped uplift. In our
example of §4 we will have ncf = 2, but the two throats are identified in the orientifold so the thraxion is
projected out.
10
We are primarily interested in the regime |zcf |2/3 ∼ |W0 |  1 where τ is much lighter than the conifold
modulus, i.e. mτ ∼ |W0 | ∼ |zcf |2/3  |zcf |1/3 ∼ mzcf . In the opposite regime |zcf |1/3  |W0 | it is more
natural in the Wilsonian sense to first integrate out τ and finally stabilize the light conifold modulus zcf ,
but our formulas are valid in both regimes.

3.3

Comments on the supergravity approximation

In the regime of small string coupling gs < 1, the curvature of the infrared region of
the throat is large in string units unless one chooses sufficiently large M to ensure that
gs M > 1. Furthermore, obtaining a substantial throat hierarchy |zcf |  1 requires choosing
K > ncf gs M > 1, and thus the contribution to the D3-brane tadpole from the throats is
generically substantial, KM  1. This leaves little room to choose appropriate bulk fluxes
that would give rise to a small flux superpotential. Given a flux tadpole Q the maximum
possible value of gs M is obtained by saturating the above inequalities, which gives
gs M |max .

p
|Q| .

(3.24)

In §4 we will work with an orientifold that has Q = −52, so that the maximum possible
gs M is of order 7. In this orientifold we will be able to find fluxes giving gs M ∼ 3. Whether
this is enough for the anti-D3-brane stability analysis of [24] to apply will be left for future
work to decide.
We note that it has been argued in [27] that the restriction (3.24) generally prevents
one from obtaining well-controlled warped throats in weakly-coupled type IIB compactifications. While it is clear that parametrically large gs M is impossible, we see no reason
why finding numerically large values should be impossible.

4

An example

In this section we will construct explicit flux vacua with small flux superpotential, exponentially close to a conifold singularity, along the lines discussed in the previous section.
We start with a certain Calabi-Yau hypersurface X in a toric fourfold Y , with Hodge
numbers h1,1 (X) = 3 and h2,1 (X) = 99, and specify an O3/O7 orientifold involution
2,1
I : X → X such that h1,1
− (X, I) = h+ (X, I) = 0. Using the Greene-Plesser description [57]
of the mirror threefold X̃ as the resolution of an orbifold X/G for a particular abelian group
G, we show that the induced action of I on X̃, denoted Ĩ : X̃ → X̃, specifies an O3/O7
2,1
orientifold involution in X̃ with h1,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) = h+ (X̃, Ĩ) = 0. For the orientifold of X̃
specified by Ĩ we will find conifold vacua with small flux superpotential.11
11

Alternatively, one can search for vacua along the G-symmetric locus in the complex structure moduli
space of the orientifold of X, as in [58]. This would require an analysis of the action of G on the three-cycles
in X, which we would like to avoid in this paper.

16

For simplicity, we choose to cancel the D7-brane tadpole locally by placing four D7branes on top of each O7-plane, with trivial gauge bundle. More precisely, we choose
diagonal worldvolume fluxes FDI = − 12 c1 (DI ) on the worldvolumes of the so(8) sevenbrane stacks on the fixed divisors DI to cancel potential Freed-Witten anomalies [59].
Furthermore, we turn on a half-integral orientifold-even NSNS two-form,
B2 =

X1
2

I

[DI ] .

(4.1)

Since c1 (DI ) = −i∗ [DI ], where i∗ is the pull-back of the two-form [DI ] to the divisor DI , the
gauge-invariant field-strengths FDI := FDI − i∗ B2 are proportional to the Poincaré duals
P
of the two-cycles in DI obtained by intersecting with J6=I [DI ]. Because the orientifoldinvariant Calabi-Yau will be smooth, the O7-planes do not intersect each other. Therefore,
the field-strengths FDI are trivial in H 2 (DI , Z) and so do not contribute to the D3-brane
and D5-brane tadpoles. In this configuration the total D3-brane charge Q of the sevenbrane stacks and O3-planes is given by
Q=−

χ(FI )

(4.2)

where χ(FI ) is the Euler characteristic of the fixed locus FI of I [60].

Each of the points in (4.3) corresponds to a prime effective divisor D
xi = 0, that intersects X transversely. The polytope ∆◦ has three FRSTs, each giving
rise to a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold with favorable embedding in Y , i.e. the divisors
b i ∩ X generate H4 (X, Z) [61]. Denoting the FI parameters by ξ a , we find that the

(4.7)

One can show that the triple intersection numbers and the second Chern class of the three
phases agree with each other in a suitable basis. Thus, it follows from Wall’s theorem [63]
that the three Calabi-Yau manifolds are all diffeomorphic to each other. Without loss of
generality we will focus on the phase CY1 .
In general, computing the Kähler cone (or its dual, the Mori cone) of a Calabi Yau
hypersurface is difficult. However, in the present example the Mori cone of the ambient
fourfold Y , M(Y ), is equivalent to the Mori cone of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface M(X).
This can be shown as follows. We have M(Y ) ⊇ M(X) as X is a holomorphic submanifold
of Y . The GV invariants of the generators of M(Y ) are non-trivial (see (4.12)), so M(X) ⊇
M(Y ).
The Stanley-Reisner (SR) ideal of this phase is13
SR = {x3 x6 , x4 x6 , x3 x7 , x1 x2 x4 x5 , x1 x2 x5 x7 } .

(4.8)

We choose to work in a basis of divisor classes H a ∈ H2 (X, Z) dual to the generators
12
13

We have computed the Kähler cone and intersection numbers using the software package CYTools [62].
We have used Sage to determine this [64].

(4.11)

In the limit ξ 1 → 0, keeping ξ 2,3 > 0, one approaches the wall in the Kähler cone that
separates CY1 from CY2 . The holomorphic curve class represented by (1, 0, 0) is GVnilpotent of order one, and lies outside the interior cone. Because this class is a generator
of the Mori cone, it also lies outside the cone generated by all other curves with nonvanishing GV invariants. Thus, as we approach the wall of the Kähler cone only the
instanton corrections in (2.13) from the curve class (1, 0, 0) become unsuppressed and
have to be resummed using (3.7). Only the period F1 develops a logarithmic singularity,
indicating a conifold singularity in the mirror dual X̃.
For later reference (using the methods developed in [65, 66]) we compute all the nonvanishing GV invariants n0(i,j,k) with j + k ≤ 2 and arbitrary i,
n0(i,0,0)

n0(i,1,0)

n0(1,1,1) = 2376

n0(1,1,0) = 2376

n0(1,0,1) = 2

n0(1,2,0) = 10260

n0(2,1,1) = 2376

n0(2,1,0) = 252

n0(2,2,0) = 206712

(4.12)

n0(3,2,0) = 10260
n0(4,2,0) = −9252
Since n0(1,0,0) = 2, we expect to find two conifold singularities in the corresponding limit in
complex structure moduli space of X̃. We will confirm this in the next section.
We now choose an orientifold using the involution
I : x2 7→ −x2 .

19

(4.13)

The fixed locus in the ambient variety is
FI ={x2 = 0} ∪ {x1 = x3 = x4 = 0} ∪ {x1 = x5 = x7 = 0} .

(4.14)

The generic Z2 -even anticanonical polynomial is non-vanishing along these loci. The third
locus does not intersect X, while the first two intersect X transversally. The first locus
gives rise to an O7-plane on the divisor D2 , and the second gives rise to a single O3-plane.
Using the adjunction formula one computes χD2 = 207. Placing four D7-branes on top of
the O7-plane, the D7-brane tadpole is canceled and the total induced D3-brane charge on
the O7-plane plus the D3-brane charge of the O3-plane is

We have h1,1

Thus we have h1,1
− (X, I) = h+ (X, I) = 0. As a consequence, none of the moduli are
projected out. In the following we will use the involution I to define an involution Ĩ in
the mirror threefold X̃.

4.2

The Greene-Plesser mirror dual

Next, we construct the orbifold X/G. We start by computing the dual polytope ∆ := (∆◦ )◦ ,
∆ ⊂ M ≃ Z4 . Its vertices are the columns of

which is a group homomorphism that maps the vertices of ∆◦ to the vertices of ∆. The
Greene-Plesser group is the group coset G := N/ı(M ) ≃ Z6 × Z6 . The two Z6 factors can
be chosen to act on the toric coordinates with charges

w
~ 2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1) .

(4.20)

The points in ∆◦ not interior to facets are mapped to the vertices of ∆, and to the further
point (−5, −4, −3, 0)t . These seven points correspond to seven G-invariant monomials of
the anticanonical line bundle of our toric fourfold Y ,

(4.21)
This represents the generic anticanonical polynomial defining X/G, or equivalently the
generic G-invariant polynomial defining a symmetric Calabi-Yau X. There exists a special
locus in moduli space where the G-symmetric X develops a set of 18 conifold singularities.
To see this one considers the patch where x3,5,7 6= 0, where we can gauge fix (part of) the
toric scaling relations by setting x3 = x5 = x7 = 1. Note that this leaves a residual scaling
equivalence (x4 , x6 ) ∼ (−x4 , −x6 ), because the toric scaling relation associated with the
third row of the GLSM charge matrix in (4.4) preserves our gauge fixing condition for
scaling parameters ±1. Furthermore, we use up the action of the algebraic torus on X
and the freedom to rescale f to set ψ0,2,3,4,5 = 1. Then, along a codimension-one locus in
moduli space specified by
ψ7 = 1 + ψ6 ,
(4.22)
one finds that f = df = 0 at the following set of points in X,
x1 = x2 = 0 ,

x64 = −1 ,

21

x66 = 1 − ψ6 .

(4.23)

Naı̈vely this is a set of 6 × 6 = 36 conifold singularities, but we need to account for the
residual scaling equivalence (x4 , x6 ) ∼ (−x4 , −x6 ) which implies that there are only 18
inequivalent conifolds. One can show that these 18 conifolds can be resolved to give the
anticanonical hypersurface in the toric fourfold specified by the GLSM charge matrix

(4.29)

defined to act on representatives [x1 : ... : x7 ] as π ◦I. Here, π : X → X/G is the projection
mod G. Since G commutes with I, the involution Ĩ is well-defined. Clearly, no complex
2,1
structure moduli are projected out by the orientifolding, i.e. h+
(X̃, Ĩ) = 0. This is simply
because none of the complex structure moduli of X were projected out by orientifolding
by I. Furthermore, we can extend the action of Ĩ to the resolution of the orbifold in such
a way that h1,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) = 0. This is done by letting all toric coordinates associated with
the resolution divisors transform trivially under the involution Ĩ. This leaves the inherited
divisor classes invariant, and one can show that in fact all divisor classes are invariant under
the involution — see Appendix A.1. Using this and the Lefschetz fixed point theorem one
computes the D3-brane tadpole for so(8) stacks as

(4.30)

where χ(FĨ ) denotes the Euler characteristic of the fixed locus FĨ of the involution Ĩ.
Alternatively, one can directly compute the Euler characteristic of the fixed locus in the
1,1
orbifold limit (see Appendix A.2), which agrees with (4.30). Since h1,1
+ (X̃, Ĩ) = h (X̃, Ĩ)
we may go away from the orbifold point in Kähler moduli space without affecting the
periods. As a consequence, we have defined an orientifold of the resolved orbifold X̃.
It remains to show that the conifolds in X correspond to conifolds in X̃, and to determine how many conifold singularities arise in the singular limit z1 → 0. To do so, we will
need to slightly change the gauge of the defining polynomial f (~x). In eq. (4.21) we have
used the continuous G-compatible ambient space automorphisms
x2 7→ x2 + λx1 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 ,

λ ∈ C,

(4.31)

in order to eliminate the monomial x21 x23 x24 x25 x26 x27 . In order to analyze the orientifold,
instead we would like to restrict to a manifestly orientifold-invariant polynomial f . Starting
from (4.21) in our gauge ψ0 = ψ2 = 1, and using (4.31) with λ = −1/2 amounts to replacing

(4.32)

which makes the defining polynomial f manifestly invariant under Ĩ.
Since (4.31) acts trivially on the locus x1 = x2 = 0 where the conifolds reside, their
position is not altered by (4.32). In X, the curve x1 = x2 = 0 can be shown (see Appendix
A) to be a fixed curve of a Z2 subgroup of the Greene-Plesser group G = Z6 ×Z6 . The coset
G/Z2 acts transitively on the 18 conifolds, so after modding out by G/Z2 we retain only
a single conifold singularity. Finally, we have to mod out by the remaining Z2 symmetry
that maps the curve x1 = x2 = 0 to itself pointwise. Locally, around a solution of (4.23),
we may embed the conifold in C4 3 (x, y, u, v) via the vanishing of the polynomial
P (x, y, u, v) = x2 + y 2 + u2 + v 2 −  + ... = 0 ,

(4.33)

with deformation parameter  such that we have dP = P = 0 on the locus x = y = u =

corrections in (x, y, u, v) as well as non-constant terms that vanish in the limit  → 0.
Locally, the Z2 -orbifold action is given by
Z2 :

(x, y) 7→ (−x, −y) ,

(4.35)

and the local action of the orientifold involution is
Ĩ :

Z

(x, y) 7→ (x, −y) ∼2 (−x, y) ,

(4.36)

so there is an O7-plane on the divisor x = 0 as well as on y = 0.
Orbifolding by (4.35) produces an A1 singularity in the ambient C2 ⊂ C4 parameterized
by (x, y), and both orientifold planes and the conifold intersect at the singular locus (see
Figure 2). As usual, we can resolve this singularity using toric geometry by introducing a
blowup coordinate α (see Figure 3 for the toric fan), and a C∗ -scaling relation
(x, α, y) ∼ (λx, λ−2 α, λy) ,

λ ∈ C∗ .

(4.37)

The locus x = y = 0 is removed (it is in the SR ideal of the toric fourfold) and replaced

which also contains the conifold singularity. Middle and right: the same slice after the
resolution of the orbifold singularity and a closeup of the exceptional divisor. The O7planes intersect the exceptional divisor α = 0 at antipodal points [1 : 0] and [0 : 1]. The
conifold singularities reside at [1 : i] and [1 : −i] and are mapped into each other by the
orientifold involution.

by the exceptional divisor α = 0. The polynomial P is replaced by
P̂ (α, x, y, u, v) = α(x2 + y 2 ) + u2 + v 2 −  = 0 ,

(4.38)

In the limit  → 0 we get not one but two conifold singularities. To see this, consider
the exceptional divisor {α = 0} ≃ P1 × C2 parameterized by homogeneous coordinates
[x : y] ∈ P1 and (u, v) ∈ C2 . For  = 0 we have P̂ = dP̂ = 0 at the two points
α = u = v = 0,

[x : y] = [1 : ±i] .

(4.39)

Indeed, the GV invariant of the curve class (1, 0, 0) that is mirror dual to the conifold S 3
has n0(1,0,0) = 2, see eq. (4.12). Finally, the O7-planes at x = 0 and y = 0 intersect the
exceptional divisor α = 0 at [x : y] = [0 : 1] and [x : y] = [1 : 0], respectively, so the
two orientifold planes no longer intersect each other and the two conifold singularities are
also separated from the O7-planes at finite blowup volume. The conifolds are moreover
mapped into each other by the involution in eq. (4.36) and are therefore identified in the
orientifold. We conclude that in the limit z 1 → 0 there appears a single conifold at generic
position in the orientifold of X̃.

Explicit flux vacua

Now we are ready to find explicit conifold vacua with small flux superpotential in the
complex structure moduli space of the Calabi-Yau orientifold discussed in the previous

For large Im(τ ) this gives a small correction to eq. (4.47), and even for relatively small
values one still finds nearby vacua of the actual F-term equation.
We will consider only those fluxes in V for which the next-to-leading corrections to
(0)
Winst are suppressed at least at the 10% level relative to the leading terms in (4.44), and
for which |zcf |  |W0 |  1. This leaves us with 696 vacua, for which we show the values
of |W0 | and |zcf | in Figure 4.16 For most of these the Klebanov-Strassler sector has small
’t Hooft coupling |gs M | < 1, and the smallest value of W0 that we find is given by (see
Table 1)
min |W0 | ≈ 7.4 × 10−9 .
(4.49)
However, there are also 63 vacua with |gs M | > 1 that may somewhat marginally live in

Strictly speaking, each of these vacua again comes as a family because we have not specified the flux
integer P which can be freely chosen in a fundamental domain of the conifold monodromy 0 ≤ P < |M |.
Since it only affects the phase of the conifold modulus, and does not contribute to the D3-brane charge its
value is of no relevance to us.

The 63 vacua with potential supergravity throats come in three families with flux superpotentials |W0 | ≈ {6.9 × 10−4 , 4.1 × 10−2 , 8.1 × 10−2 }, but with vastly different values of
|zcf |. We have checked that the neglected two-instanton corrections are suppressed by a
relative factor of order |W0 | and the three-instanton corrections are suppressed by further
such factors. We show the values of |W0 | and |zcf | in Figure 5.

the region below which the supergravity approximation fails. Determining such a threshold would be
worthwhile.

Discussion

In this work we have demonstrated that the mechanism of [5] for constructing flux vacua
of type IIB string theory with exponentially small values of the flux superpotential can be
applied not just at large complex structure, as in [5], but also near conifold points in moduli
space. We laid out a procedure for finding conifold vacua in which the flux superpotential
is small.
The key challenge was to compute, and then to cancel, an order-one contribution to the
superpotential coming from flux on the conifold cycles. To accomplish this we considered
the case in which the shrinking three-cycle of the conifold in a Calabi-Yau X̃ is mirror to
a shrinking curve in the mirror threefold X. Computing the prepotential for the complex
structure moduli space of X̃, and then resumming the terms corresponding to type IIA
worldsheet instantons wrapping the shrinking curve in X, we obtained the flux superpotential for type IIB compactification on X̃, including the term resulting from fluxes on the
shrinking three-cycle of the conifold. We then applied the mechanism of [5] to find fluxes
for which the total flux superpotential, including the conifold term, is exponentially small.
We illustrated our approach in flux compactification of type IIB string theory on an
orientifold of a Calabi-Yau threefold X̃ with h1,1 (X̃) = 99 and h2,1 (X̃) = 3. To analyze
X̃ and its orientifold we made heavy use of the Greene-Plesser construction: X̃ is the
resolution of the orbifold X/G, with X the mirror of X̃, and G ≃ Z6 × Z6 the GreenePlesser group of X. We found an O3/O7 orientifold involution Ĩ of X̃ leading to a D3-brane
tadpole −Q = 52, allowing reasonable freedom in choosing fluxes. We found many flux
vacua and laid out in detail a flux choice for which |W0 | ≈ 7 × 10−4 , the conifold modulus
zcf is stabilized at |zcf | ≈ 5 × 10−6 , and the Klebanov-Strassler throat has gs M ≈ 1.5.
As classical flux vacua, our examples are rather well-controlled. However, they are
just a first step toward finding parametrically large Klebanov-Strassler throats in vacua
with small values of the flux superpotential, and subsequently achieving Kähler moduli
stabilization and a metastable uplift to de Sitter space. Indeed, in our examples tendimensional supergravity is at best marginally valid near the tip of the throat, and at the
same time the significant number of Kähler moduli makes stabilization computationally
challenging. We believe that these limitations have no deep relationship to our mechanism,
but are instead accidental properties of the examples. After all, we would expect to have
to search through many candidate geometries to find one in which the flux superpotential
is exponentially small, a throat region is parametrically large, and the numbers of moduli
are small enough for simultaneous computational control of the geometry and its mirror.
32

Here we have examined one particularly tractable orientifold with h2,1 (X̃) = 3, and already
finding therein a foundation for a parametrically controlled KKLT de Sitter vacuum would
have been surprising to us.
One further limitation, however, is intrinsic to our mechanism, and will hold in all
examples: at least one linear combination of the string coupling and the complex structure
moduli remains rather light, with a mass of the same order as that of the Kähler moduli.
As noted in [5], this is a departure from the original scenario of [1]. In the present context of
conifold vacua, an important consequence is that the warp factor at the tip of the KlebanovStrassler throat is set by the vev of a relatively light field.18 Metastable supersymmetry
breaking in the presence of such light moduli will require further analysis.
Systematically enumerating conifold vacua in a much larger class of geometries will be
very informative, but we leave this for future work.

The D3-brane tadpole in the orbifold

In this appendix we will compute the Euler characteristic χ(FĨ ) of the fixed locus FĨ of
the orientifold involution Ĩ, as promised in eq. (4.30), in two different ways. First, in §A.1
2,1
we will show directly that h1,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) = h+ (X̃, Ĩ) = 0 for the involution Ĩ : X̃ → X̃, by
using the description of X̃ as a smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a toric fourfold Ỹ . We
then use the Lefschetz fixed point theorem to compute the Euler characteristic. Then, in
§A.2 we go to the orbifold limit X̃ → X/G and compute the Euler characteristic directly.
The two computations agree.
18

Qualitatively similar results have been emphasized in [27, 29], though the details and the causes are
very different here.

A.1

Computation in the resolved orbifold

2,1
In this section, we verify that h1,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) = 0 and h− (X̃, Ĩ) = 3 under the orientifold
involution Ĩ in the resolved orbifold.
First, let us briefly review how the anticanonical monomials and the automorphism
group of the ambient fourfold Ỹ are determined from polytope data. Let ∆◦ ∈ M be the
Newton polyhedron for the anticanonical class of Y and let ∆ ∈ N be the dual polytope of
∆◦ . A point ρ ∈ ∆ ∩ N corresponds to an edge of the toric fan of Y and thus corresponds
to a homogeneous coordinate xρ . Similarly, each point v ∈ ∆◦ ∩ M determines a monomial
xv ,

xv =

ρ∈∆∩N

As was shown in [61], a point m ∈ ∆◦ ∩ M strictly interior to a facet corresponds to a nontrivial so-called root automorphism. Because m is in a facet, there is a point ρm ∈ ∆ ∩ N
such that hm, ρm i = −1 and hm, ρi > −1, ∀ρ 6= ρm . Then the action of the automorphism
of the group element m is
xρm 7→ xρm + λm

λm ∈ C .

(A.2)

ρ0 6=ρm

Let A be the automorphism group of Ỹ . Then, its connected component containing the
identity is generated by the root automorphisms, as well as the action of the algebraic
torus (C∗ )4 × Ỹ → Ỹ . Thus, the dimension of the automorphism group A is given by
dim A = 4 +

X

`∗ (Θ◦ ) ,

(A.3)

codimΘ◦ =1

where for a face Θ◦ ⊂ ∆◦ , `∗ (Θ◦ ) denotes the number of points in the interior of Θ◦ .
Given the anticanonical monomials and the automorphisms of Y , we can compute the
number of Kähler moduli h1,1 (X̃) and the number of complex structure moduli h2,1 (X̃)
of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface X̃. If a Kähler modulus is inherited from the ambient
variety, then we call that Kähler modulus toric. We define h1,1
toric (X̃) to be the number
of toric Kähler moduli. Similarly, we define toric complex structure deformations to be
deformations of the coefficients of the anticanonical monomials modulo the deformations
that can be undone by elements of A, and modulo the overall scale. Likewise, we define

34

h2,1
toric (X̃) as the number of toric complex structure moduli. We have
h2,1
toric (X̃) = #(monomials) − dim A − 1 =

X

`∗ (Θ◦ ) − 4 .

(A.4)

codimΘ◦ ≥2

To determine h1,1
toric (X̃), we recall that each point on ∆ gives rise to a homogeneous coordiP
19
nate. Hence, naı̈vely there are codimΘ≥1 `∗ (Θ) toric divisors. However, points interior to
facets correspond to ambient divisors that do not intersect the Calabi-Yau. Furthermore,
there are in total four linear relations among the toric divisors. As a result, we obtain
h1,1
toric (X̃) =

X

`∗ (Θ) − 4 .

(A.5)

codimΘ≥2

The Calabi-Yau X̃ considered in §4 has h2,1 (X̃) = 3 and h1,1 (X̃) = 99, and from the
1,1
corresponding pair of dual polytopes ∆, ∆◦ one finds h2,1
toric (X̃) = 3 and htoric (X̃) = 97.
Thus all complex structure moduli of X̃ are toric, but two generators of the Picard group
are non-toric. In order to determine the orientifold action on H4 (X̃, Z) we must therefore
consider the non-toric divisors in more detail. Consider a point ρ ∈ Θ, with codimΘ = 2.
Then {xρ = 0} ∩ X̃ is a reducible variety in X̃ and there are 1 + `∗ (Θ◦ ) irreducible
P
components [61, 69]. Hence, there are in total codimΘ=2 `∗ (Θ)`∗ (Θ◦ ) non-toric divisors.
As a result, we obtain
X

1,1
h1,1 (X̃) = htoric
(X̃) +

`∗ (Θ)`∗ (Θ◦ ) .

(A.6)

codimΘ=2

For a point ρ, we call the divisor {xρ = 0} strictly favorable if either ρ is not interior to
any two-face or it is interior to a two-face Θ but `∗ (Θ◦ ) = 0.
Given isomorphisms i◦ : M → Z4 and i : N → Z4 , we can assign coordinates to points
in ∆◦ ∩ M and ∆ ∩ N. Including the origin, the points in ∆◦ ∩ Z4 are

(A.8)

The first six points in (A.8) are the vertices of ∆ ∩ Z4 . There is only one two-face Θ̌ ∈ ∆
such that `∗ (Θ̌◦ ) 6= 0, and for this face `∗ (Θ̌◦ ) = 1. The last two points in (A.8) are strictly
interior to Θ̌, and hence each of those two points yields the union of two distinct divisors
in X̃. For notational simplicity we will suppress the dependence of the monomials on all
the homogeneous coordinates except those that are explicitly presented in (A.8). We will
denote by xi the coordinate given by the ith column.
The most general polynomial f is
6 5 4
f (~x) =ψ0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 − ψ1 x61 − ψ2 x22 x8 x9 − ψ3 x64 x66 x67 x28 x9 − ψ4 x63 x12
4 x7 x8 x9

− ψ5 x35 x66 x37 − ψ6 x63 x65 x8 x29 − ψ7 x63 x64 x35 x37 x38 x39 − ψ8 x21 x23 x24 x25 x26 x27 x8 x9 .

(A.9)

The action of the root automorphism is
x2 7→ x2 + λx1 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 .

(A.10)

Hence, we confirm that h2,1 (X̃) = 9 − 5 − 1 = 3.
Now consider an orientifold action Ĩ : x2 7→ −x2 . The most general Ĩ-invariant polynomial fĨ contains 8 monomials,
6 5 4
fĨ (~x) = − ψ1 x61 − ψ2 x22 x8 x9 − ψ3 x64 x66 x67 x28 x9 − ψ4 x63 x12
4 x7 x8 x9

− ψ5 x35 x66 x37 − ψ6 x63 x65 x8 x29 − ψ7 x63 x64 x35 x37 x38 x39 − ψ8 x21 x23 x24 x25 x26 x27 x8 x9 .

(A.11)

Because the nontrivial root automorphism of eq. (A.10) does not commute with Ĩ we
have dim AĨ = 4, where AĨ is the subgroup of A that commutes with the orientifold
involution. As a result, there are in total three independent complex structure moduli,
i.e. h2,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) = 8 − 4 − 1 = 3.
Next, we consider the structure of the non-toric divisors. To simplify the computation,
we will blow down all of the blowup divisors whose blowup coordinates are implicit in
36

eq. (A.8). First, we consider the locus x8 = f = 0. We have
f |x8 =0 = −ψ1 x61 − ψ5 x35 x66 x37 .

(A.12)

We verified that x1 = x8 = 0 does not intersect X by confirming that the intersection
numbers of {x1 = 0}, {x8 = 0}, and {xρ = 0} are trivial for any ρ, i.e. x1 x8 is in the
SR ideal. Hence, for f |x8 =0 to have a solution, x5 x6 x7 must not vanish. Using the toric
rescaling, we set ψ1 = −1 and ψ5 = 1. Then naı̈vely we obtain six disconnected solutions
x21 = ω3i x5 x26 x7 ,

(A.13)

for i = 0, 1, 2, where ω3 is a third root of unity. However, there is a Z3 subgroup of the
Greene-Plesser group G, (4.20), with the charge
~λZ = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1) .
3

(A.14)

This subgroup acts non-trivially on x5 x26 x7 ,
Z3 : x5 x26 x7 7→ ω3 x5 x26 x7 .

(A.15)

One can verify that G/Z3 acts trivially on (x5 x26 x7 )1/2 . As a result, there are two solutions
to x8 = f = 0:
x1 = ±(x5 x26 x7 )1/2 .
(A.16)
Likewise, the surface x9 = f = 0 splits into the two solutions of eq. (A.16).
1,1
Using this we proceed to compute h−
(X̃, Ĩ). Clearly, Ĩ acts trivially on the strictly
favorable divisors {xρ = 0}. Hence, we only need to check how Ĩ acts on the solutions of
x8 = f = 0 and x9 = f = 0. As (A.16) does not explicitly depend on x2 , the orientifold
involution acts trivially on the solutions of (A.16). Thus, the orientifold action on H4 (X̃, Z)
is trivial, and so h1,1
− (X̃, Ĩ) = 0.
Finally, we can compute the Euler characteristic χ(FĨ ) of the fixed locus FĨ of Ĩ using
the Lefschetz fixed point theorem,

Computation in the orbifold limit

The orientifold fixed locus in the orbifold X/G contains the G-orbifold of the orientifoldfixed locus in X, but also further loci whose lifts in X are the sets of points mapped by
the orientifold to distinct points in the same G-orbit. It is straightforward to show that
the full fixed locus FĨ in X/G is
FĨ ≡ F/G = (D1 ∪ D2 ∪ D3 ∪ D4 ∪ D6 )/G .

(A.18)

We can compute the Euler characteristic of an orbifold as in [53, 57]. We partition F as
F = ∪I FfHI where the FfHI are the sets of points in F that are fixed pointwise by subgroups
HI ⊂ G. Then, we have
X χ(FfH )|HI |

χ(F/G) =

(A.19)
|F

where FI are the subgroups of G/HI that act freely (i.e. without fixed points) on FfHI . As
our group G acts via multiplication by phases on the toric coordinates, the FfHI are the
loci where a subset of the toric coordinates are set to zero, with subloci removed where
further toric coordinates vanish. Such loci are mapped to themselves by all of G, so we
have FI = G/HI . First, let us define toric divisors Di , curves Cij and sets of points Pijk as
Di = {xi = 0} ,

Cij = {xi = xj = 0} ,

with pairwise distinct indices.



D̂i = Di \ ∪j6=i Cij

(A.20)

The FfHI can be chosen to be the above with lower-



∪j6=k6=i Pijk ,

Ĉij = Cij \ ∪k6=i6=j Pijk ,

P̂ijk = Pijk .

(A.21)

Along the dense subset D̂1 ∪ D̂2 ∪ D̂3 ∪ D̂4 ∪ D̂6 in X, the full group G acts without fixed
points. The Euler characteristics of the Di are χi = (45, 207, 11, 13, 24).
The curves Ĉij are invariant under certain subgroups recorded on the left in Table 2.
The points Pijk are invariant under the subgroups listed on the right in Table 2. The Euler
characteristics of the non-compact curves Ĉij are obtained from those of Cij by subtracting
the Euler characteristics of the points Pijk ⊂ Cij , which we also record in Table 2. The
Euler characteristics χ̂i of the non-compact divisors D̂i , i = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are likewise given
by subtracting the Euler characteristics of the curves Ĉij ⊂ Di and points Pijk ⊂ Di . The
