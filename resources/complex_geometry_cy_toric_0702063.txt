Abstract
These are introductory lecture notes on complex geometry, Calabi–Yau manifolds
and toric geometry. We first define basic concepts of complex and Kähler geometry.
We then proceed with an analysis of various definitions of Calabi–Yau manifolds. The
last section provides a short introduction to toric geometry, aimed at constructing
Calabi–Yau manifolds in two different ways; as hypersurfaces in toric varieties and as
local toric Calabi–Yau threefolds. These lecture notes supplement a mini-course that
was given by the author at the Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics 2005,
and at CERN in 2007.

General remarks
In these lectures I assume a basic knowledge of differential geometry and vector bundles
on real manifolds. If needed the reader may want to consult for instance [20].
The two first sections use what I would call a ‘bundle’ approach to complex geometry,
following closely the treatment of [18] and the first chapters of [16]. For a more traditional
approach (from a physicist’s point of view), I would recommend the lectures on complex
geometry by Philip Candelas [9] and Nakahara’s book [20].
In the third section I define Calabi–Yau manifolds and consider in details two examples of
Calabi–Yau threefolds. A good reference (for mathematically-oriented physicists) on Calabi–
Yau manifolds is [17].
Section 4 is almost independent of the three other sections. It provides a quick introduction to toric geometry, focusing on constructing Calabi–Yau manifolds in toric geometry. It
is clearly not self-contained and should be seen as a complement to standard references in
toric geometry such as [23, 13, 12]. This section is mainly based on the second chapter of
[4].
I do not pretend to add anything new to these standard mathematical topics in these
lecture notes; in fact, various definitions and propositions have been borrowed almost literally
from the references cited above. Rather, the aim is to provide an opportunity for students and
researchers in mathematical physics to get a grip on these mathematical concepts without
having to go through the standard lengthy books. I also tried to build a bridge between the
mathematical and physical expositions on these subjects. However, for the sake of brevity
most proofs are omitted, and various interesting topics are not even discussed.
Indeed, it is obvious that a proper introduction to the subject of these lecture notes
requires much more than a four hour crash course. Therefore, I had to make some choices
in the topics covered; my selection was mainly dictated by applications in string theory.
Finally, if the reader is not sure about the meaning of certain concepts, I recommend doing
a search on http://wikipedia.org/. And don’t forget that Wikipedia is a collaborative
project; add your own comments and definitions if needed!
Acknowledgments. I would like to thank Philip Candelas, Wen Jiang, Marcos Mariño
and Fonger Ypma for interesting discussions while writing these lecture notes. I owe special
thanks to Wen Jiang for proof reading these notes before the Modave school. My work was
partly supported by a Rhodes Scholarship and an NSERC PGS Doctoral (and Postdoctoral)
Fellowship.

Complex geometry

In this section we define complex manifolds, develop calculus on them and define a few
important topological invariants. We assume that the reader is familiar with real manifolds;
hence, this section may be understood as providing the complex analogs to the familiar
concepts of real geometry.

1.1

Complex manifolds

Let us first define complex manifolds in two different ways. For a third definition involving
principal bundles, see [18].
Definition 1.1. Let M be a real 2m-dimensional manifold and {Ui } an open covering on
M. On each open subset Ui , we define a coordinate chart to be the pair (Ui , ψi ) where
ψi : U → Cm is an homeomorphism from Ui to an open subset of Cm (that is ψi gives a set
i
of complex coordinates z1i , . . . , zm
on Ui ). We say that the data (M, {Ui , ψi }) is a complex
manifold if for every non-empty intersections Ui ∩ Uj the transition functions ψij = ψj ◦ ψi−1 :
ψi (Ui ∩ Uj ) → ψj (Ui ∩ Uj ) are holomorphic as maps from Cm to itself (i.e. they depend
only on the zµ but not on their complex conjugate). m is called the complex dimension of a
complex manifold.

Thus, roughly speaking, a complex manifold is a topological space that locally looks
like Cm . By the definition above we see that a complex manifold is always a real manifold.
However, the converse is not always true: when does a real manifold can be seen as a complex

1.1 Complex manifolds

manifold, that is when does a real manifold admit a complex structure? The second definition
of complex manifolds answers this interesting question.
But let us first fix some notation.
Remark 1.2. In the following, we will always use latin indices for real coordinates and greek
indices for complex coordinates. Moreover, zµ̄ will be a shorthand for z̄µ̄ , where µ̄ is a normal
tensor index.
Remark 1.3. To fix notation: let M be a real n-manifold, with tangent bundle T M and
cotangent bundle T ∗ M. A smooth section S of the tensor product bundle ⊗k T M ⊗l T ∗ M is
called a tensor field of type (k, l) on M, and its components in a local coordinate basis are
k
denoted by Sab11 ,...,b
,...,al . The space of tensor fields (the space of sections) of type (k, l) on M is
k
denoted by Γ(⊗ T M ⊗l T ∗ M). In fact, given any vector bundle E, we will always denote
its space of sections by Γ(E).
Let M be a real 2m-dimensional manifold. We define an almost complex structure J on
M to be a smooth tensor field J ∈ Γ(T M ⊗ T ∗ M) on M satisfying Jab Jbc = −δac .
Now take a vector field v ∈ Γ(T M), with components v a in a coordinate basis, and use
the fact that J is a map on tangent spaces to define a new vector field (Jv)b = Jab v a . Since
Jab Jbc = −δac , we see that J(Jv) = −v, that is J 2 = −1. Therefore, roughly speaking J is a
generalization of the usual multiplication by ±i in complex analysis; it gives to each tangent
space Tp M to a point p in M the structure of a complex vector space. We say that a real
2m-dimensional manifold endowed with an almost complex structure J is an almost complex
manifold.
For two vector fields v, w, define now a vector field NJ (v, w) by
NJ (v, w) = [v, w] + J[v, Jw] + J[Jv, w] − [Jv, Jw],

(1.1)

where [, ] denotes the Lie bracket of vector fields.2 N is called the Nijenhuis tensor. In local
coordinates it is given by
a
Nbc
= Jbd (∂d Jca − ∂c Jda ) − Jcd (∂d Jba − ∂b Jda ).

(1.2)

We can now state our second definition of complex manifolds.
Definition 1.4. Let M be a 2m-dimensional real manifold and J an almost complex structure on M. If N ≡ 0, we call J a complex structure on M. A complex manifold is defined by
the data (M, J) where J is a complex structure on M.
The Lie bracket [v, w] of two vector fields given in a coordinate basis by v a ∂a and wb ∂b is defined by
(v ∂a wb − wa ∂a v b )∂b .

It follows from a theorem by Newlander and Nirenberg (which we will not prove here)
that the two definitions are equivalent. Namely, the theorem states that it is possible to find
local complex coordinates with holomorphic transition functions if and only if the almost
complex structure is integrable, which is equivalent to say that its Nijenhuis tensor vanishes.
Therefore, a real manifold can be considered as a complex manifold only if it admits a
complex structure J. Let us now pause to give a few examples of complex manifolds.
Example 1.5. The simplest example of a complex manifold of complex dimension m is Cm ,
which obviously admits a global coordinate chart.
Example 1.6. A very important family of complex manifolds are the complex projective
spaces, denoted by CPm (often written simply as Pm ). These are the spaces of complex lines
through the origin in Cm+1 . Take the space Cm+1 \{0} and quotient by the identification
(z0 , . . . , zm ) ∼ λ(z0 , . . . , zm ),

(1.3)

where λ is any non-zero complex number. We call the zµ homogeneous coordinates on CPm .
One way to show that it is a complex manifold is to define a set of coordinate charts with
holomorphic transition functions. Since the zµ are not all zero, we can choose an open
covering defined by the open subsets
Uα = {zα 6= 0}.

(1.4)

On each Uα we define coordinates ζµα = zµ /zα , which we call inhomogeneous coordinates (or
affine coordinates). On the intersection Uα ∩ Uβ we have that
ζµα =

ζµβ
zµ
zµ zβ
=
= α,
zα
zβ zα
ζβ

(1.5)

since both zα and zβ are non-zero on the intersection. Therefore, the transition function
(µ)
ψαβ : ζµα(Uα ∩ Uβ ) → ζµβ (Uα ∩ Uβ ) is simply a multiplication by (ζβα )−1 , which is of course
holomorphic. The manifolds CPm are also compact, which we will not prove here.
Example 1.7. Let us now consider submanifolds of the above complex manifolds. If, for the
moment, we restrict our attention to compact complex manifolds, we see that submanifolds
of Cm are not very interesting, since a theorem that we will not prove here (see [9] for a simple
proof) states that a connected compact analytic submanifold of Cm is a point. However,
many compact complex manifolds can be constructed as submanifolds of projective spaces
CPm . We saw that CPm is compact; all its closed complex submanifolds are also compact. In
fact, there is a theorem by Chow that states that all such submanifolds of CPm can be realized
as the zero locus of a finite number of homogeneous polynomial equations (which means
polynomial equations homogeneous in the homogeneous coordinates zµ ). One important
example is the Fermat quintic in CP4 , given as the zero locus of the equation

1.2 Tensors on complex manifolds

This three-dimensional compact complex manifold turns out to be Calabi–Yau, probably the
most studied Calabi–Yau threefold. We will come back to this manifold in section 3.3.3.
One can also generalize the construction above by considering the zero locus of a finite
number of homogeneous polynomial equations in a product of projective spaces, rather than
a single projective space. This generalization leads to a large number of manifolds, many of
them Calabi–Yau. Complex manifolds constructed as the zero locus of a set of polynomial
equations are usually called complete intersections. We will give some examples of these in
section 3.3.4.
Example 1.8. Let us consider, as a final example in this section, a simple generalization
of complex projective spaces: weighted projective spaces. Basically, instead of quotienting
by a C∗ action acting as in (1.3), one assigns a different weight to each coordinate of Cm+1 .
For instance, the two-dimensional weighted projective space CP(2,3,1) can be constructed by
taking the space C3 \ {0} and quotienting by the C∗ action
(z0 , z1 , z2 ) ∼ (λ2 z0 , λ3 z1 , λz2 ),

(1.7)

where λ is a non-zero complex number; the superscripts (2, 3, 1) denote the weights of the
C∗ action. It is easy to show, as for projective spaces, that this is a compact complex
manifold. Moreover, one can consider as in the previous example hypersurfaces and complete
intersections in weighted projective spaces and products thereof.

1.2

Tensors on complex manifolds

In the previous section we introduced the notion of a complex structure J, which can be
understood as an endomorphism of real tangent spaces: at a point p of M, J gives a linear
map J : Tp M → Tp M. Let us now complexify the tangent space Tp M to get Tp M ⊗ C,
which is a complex vector space isomorphic to C2m . The map Jp extends naturally to a map
J : Tp M ⊗ C → Tp M ⊗ C.
(1,0)

(0,1)

Since J 2 = −1, the eigenvalues of J in Tp M ⊗ C are ±i. Now let Tp M (resp. Tp M)
denote the eigenspace of Jp with eigenvalue i (resp. −i). Both eigenspaces are isomorphic to
(1,0)
Cm , complex conjugate to each other, and we have the decomposition Tp M ⊗ C = Tp M ⊕
(0,1)
Tp M. Since this works at any point p of M, it can be extended to the full bundle T M;
that is, the complexified tangent bundle (which we will now denote by TC M) decomposes
as TC M = T (1,0) M ⊕ T (0,1) M. We call T (1,0) M (resp. T (0,1) M) the holomorphic (resp.
anti-holomorphic) tangent bundle. In some way, by complexifying the tangent bundle and
using the action of the complex structure, we trade the real tangent bundle T M for the
holomorphic tangent bundle T (1,0) M.
Remark 1.9. As noted above to obtain this decomposition we must complexify the tangent
bundle, that is its sections are given by complex-valued vector fields on a complex manifold.

1.3 Exterior forms on complex manifolds

It is important to note the difference between having a complex manifold and complexifying
the vector bundles, which is not the same thing. In principle, we could consider real vector
bundles on complex manifolds, which would lead to real-valued tensor fields on complex
manifolds, or complex vector bundles on real manifolds, which would give complex-valued
tensor fields on real manifolds.
The decomposition into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic pieces carries through to complexified cotangent bundles as well, hence TC∗ M = T ∗(1,0) M ⊕ T ∗(0,1) M. Now, since a tensor
field is defined as a section of tensor products of tangent and cotangent bundles, we expect
to find a similar decomposition for complex-valued tensor fields on complex manifolds.
Remark 1.10. We remarked earlier that zµ̄ was a shorthand for z̄µ̄ . Similarly, for general
tensors, the indices ᾱ, β̄, µ̄, . . . are tensor indices, but they indicate a modification to the
tensor itself.

S... + S... and Tb... = Tβ... + Tβ̄... . Therefore, these operations on tensors are projections:
the ‘α’ operation projects on the holomorphic piece, while the ‘ᾱ’ operation projects on the
anti-holomorphic piece.

Moreover, it is easy to show that in this notation Jba = iδβα − iδβ̄ᾱ , which means that
J acts on tensor indices α, β, . . . (resp. ᾱ, β̄, . . .) by multiplication by i (resp. −i). Thus,
tensors (at a point p) with indices α, β, . . . lie in a tensor product of the holomorphic tangent
and cotangent spaces, while tensors with indices ᾱ, β̄, . . . lie in a tensor product of the antiholomorphic tangent and cotangent spaces. In particular, a vector v α is called a holomorphic
vector, while a vector v ᾱ is called an anti-holomorphic vector, and we have the decomposition
v a = v α + v ᾱ . This yields the desired decomposition of tensor fields into holomorphic and
anti-holomorphic parts.

1.3

Exterior forms on complex manifolds

Let us first recall some properties of exterior forms on real manifolds.
Definition 1.11. Let M be a real n-dimensional manifold. The k-th exterior (or wedge)
power of the cotangent bundle T ∗ M (defined by the exterior product of its sections below)
is written Λk T ∗ M. Smooth sections of Λk T ∗ M are called k-forms, and the vector space of
k-forms is denoted by Γ(Λk T ∗ M) or Ωk (M).
Thus, r-forms are totally antisymmetric tensor fields of type (0, r). We can define the
exterior product (or wedge product) ∧ and the exterior derivative d of k-forms as follows.

1.4 Cohomology

10

Let α be a k-form and β be a l-form, then α ∧ β is a (k + l)-form and dα is a (k + 1)-form
defined by (in component notation)
(α ∧ β)a1 ...ak+l = α[a1 ...ak βak+1 ...ak+l ] ,

(1.8)

(dα)a1 ...ak = ∂[a1 αa2 ...ak+1 ] ,

(1.9)

where [. . .] denotes complete antisymmetrization.
It follows that
d(dα) = 0,

α ∧ β = (−1)kl β ∧ α,

d(α ∧ β) = (dα) ∧ β + (−1)k α ∧ (dβ).

(1.10)

The first property is usually denoted by d2 = 0. We say that a r-form α is closed if it
satisfies dα = 0, and exact if it can be written as α = dβ for some (r − 1)-form. Since d2 = 0,
any exact form is closed.
Now we want to study exterior forms on complex manifolds. Using the decomposition of
the complexified cotangent bundle, it is easy to show that the following complexified bundles
decompose as
k
M
Λk TC∗ M =
Λj,k−j M,
(1.11)
j=0

where we defined Λp,q M := Λp T ∗(1,0) M ⊗ Λq T ∗(0,1) M. A section of Λp,q M is called a (p, q)form, which is a complex-valued differential form with p holomorphic pieces and q antiholomorphic pieces. We denote the vector space of (p, q)-forms by Γ(Λp,q M) or Ωp,q (M), and
the vector space of complexified k-forms by Γ(Λk TC∗ M) or ΩkC (M).
On a complex manifold, the exterior derivative also admits a simple decomposition:
¯ where we defined the operators ∂ : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp+1,q (M) and ∂¯ : Ωp,q (M) →
d = ∂ + ∂,
¯ = 0. We can also
Ωp,q+1 (M). The identity d2 = 0 implies that ∂ 2 = ∂¯2 = 0 and ∂ ∂¯ + ∂∂
k+1
define a real operator dc : ΩkC (M) → ΩC (M) by dc = i(∂¯ − ∂), which satisfies
ddc + dc d = 0,

1.4

(dc )2 = 0,

∂ = (d + idc ),

Cohomology

Cohomology is a very important part of geometry. To motivate the introduction of cohomology, let us make an analogy with gauge theories in physics.
In a physical gauge theory, gauge transformations correspond to mathematical transformations that do not change the physics. Hence, any physical observable must be gauge
invariant. Another way of seeing this is to define equivalence classes, by which we mean
classes of objects that only differ by gauge transformations. Observables could then be
defined as equivalence classes, since by definition these classes are gauge invariant.

1.4 Cohomology

11

In geometry, we are interested in finding fundamental properties of geometrical systems.
Hence, we also want to define some objects that are invariant under ‘uninteresting’ transformations, analogous to gauge transformations in physics. This is precisely what cohomology
theories provide.
For instance, topological invariants are of prime importance in the study of manifolds.
There are various topological invariants that one can define on a manifold; cohomology
theories and characteristic classes (for instance Chern classes) provide many of them. In
fact, even from a physics point of view topological invariants are important: many physical
questions can be reformulated as questions about topological invariants of manifolds, for
example in compactifications of string theory and in supersymmetry.
Let us start by giving a broad definition of the concept of cohomology groups.
Definition 1.12. Let A0 , A1 , . . . be abelian groups connected by homomorphisms dn : An →
An+1 , such that the composition of two consecutive maps is zero: dn+1 ◦ dn = 0 for all n. We
can then form the cochain complex
d0
d1
d2
d3
0 → A0 → A1 → A2 → . . .

(1.13)

The cohomology groups H k are defined by
Hk =

Ker(dk : Ak → Ak+1)
.
Im(dk−1 : Ak−1 → Ak )

(1.14)

The elements of H k are the equivalence classes alluded to above, consisting of elements
in Ker(dk ) that only differ by a transformation in Im(dk−1 ).
With this general definition of cohomology groups, defining a particular cohomology
boils down to finding a collection of abelian groups and homomorphisms such that the
above definition holds. The first cohomology theory that we will look at is defined over real
manifolds.
Definition 1.13. Let M be a real n-dimensional manifold. As d2 = 0, we can form the
complex

(M, R) =

Ker(d : Ωk (M) → Ωk+1 (M))

Im(d : Ωk−1 (M) → Ωk (M))

(1.16)

k
In other words, HdR
(M, R) is the set of closed k-forms where two forms are considered
equivalent if they differ by an exact form, i.e. ω ≃ ω + dα; it is the quotient of the vector

1.4 Cohomology

space of closed k-forms on M by the vector space of exact k-forms on M. That is, given a
k
closed k-form ω, its cohomology class [ω] ∈ HdR
(M, R) is the space of closed k-forms which
differ from ω by an exact form. We call ω a representative of [ω].
We can see in the definition of de Rham cohomology groups that the complex terminates.
This is because there is no antisymmetric (n + 1)-tensor field on an n-manifold.
k
Remark 1.14. The R in HdR
(M, R) means that the closed k-forms are real, i.e. they are
elements of Ωk (M). However, we can also define the de Rham cohomology groups for comk
plexified k-forms, that is elements of ΩkC (M), which we denote by HdR
(M, C).

Using cohomology groups we can define some important topological invariants. We define
k
the Betti numbers bk = dimR HdR
(M, R). We can also define the Euler characteristic as the
alternating sum of the Betti numbers:

Remark that the Dolbeault cohomology groups depend on the complex structure of M.

Note also that we could have defined the cohomology groups using ∂ instead of ∂,
just a matter of convention since they are complex conjugate.
We now define the Hodge numbers to be hp,q = dim H∂p,q

13

The (m + 1)2 Hodge numbers are not independent; there are many relations between
them, depending on the kind of complex manifold we are looking at. We will investigate
some of them in sections 2 and 3.
There are many other cohomology groups that one can define on a manifold, for instance
the well-known Čech cohomology groups; they are all isomorphic on smooth manifolds. For
the purpose of these lectures the de Rham and Dolbeault cohomology groups will suffice.

1.5

Chern classes

Given a fiber F , a structure group3 G and a base space M, we may construct many fiber
bundles over M, depending on the choice of transition functions. It is an interesting problem
to classify these bundles and see how much they differ from the trivial bundle M ×F . In order
to do so, characteristic classes are what we are looking for; they are subsets of cohomology
classes of the base space which measure the non-triviality, or twisting, of the bundle. In
other words, they are ‘obstructions’ which prevent a bundle from being a trivial bundle.
In this section we focus on a particular kind of characteristic classes, namely Chern
classes, using their differential geometry definition (for a purely topological definition see for
instance [16]).
Much more than what we present here could be said about characteristic classes. For
instance, we could have discussed in more details the Chern character and Todd classes,
which have important applications in physics; in particular for computing the index of some
physically relevant operators using the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. But four hours is not
enough to enter into this subject; more information on these topics can be found for instance
in [20, 16, 14, 15].
For the sake of brevity we will not give here the general definition of characteristic classes
in terms of invariants polynomials and cohomology classes; the reader is referred to chapter 11
of [20]. It may be an interesting exercise to show that Chern classes are indeed characteristic
classes according to the general definition.
Definition 1.16. Let E be a complex vector bundle over a manifold M, and let F =
dA + A ∧ A be the curvature two-form of a connection A on E. We define the total Chern
class c(E) of E by
i
F ).
(1.21)
c(E) = det(1 +
2π
Since F is a two-form, c(E) is a direct sum of forms of even degrees. We define the Chern
classes ck (E) ∈ H 2k (M, R) by the expansion of c(E):
c(E) = 1 + c1 (E) + c2 (E) + . . . .
3

(1.22)

The structure group G of a fiber bundle E is a Lie group acting on the left on the fibers F . Roughly
speaking, the transition functions on overlapping coordinate charts take values in the structure group G.

1.5 Chern classes

14

Remark 1.17. To be more precise, the ck (E) in the expansion are called the Chern forms,
which are closed (2k)-forms, while the Chern classes are defined as the cohomology classes
of the Chern forms. Therefore, Chern classes are cohomology classes, while the Chern forms
are representatives of the Chern classes.
This definition relies on a connection A on the bundle, so one may think that Chern classes
depend on a choice of connection A. Fortunately this is not the case. For different curvatures
F and F ′ , the difference between the two invariant polynomials is an exact form, that is the
two invariant polynomials are in the same cohomology class. Since the cohomology classes
defined by invariant polynomials form what is called characteristic classes, in the present
case Chern classes, it follows that Chern classes are independent of the choice of connection,
but that different connections will lead to different representatives of the cohomology classes
ck . A complete proof of this fact is given in chapter 11 of [20].
Since F is a two-form, on an n-dimensional manifold the Chern classes cj (E) with 2j > n
vanish identically. Also, irrespective of the dimension of M, the series terminates at ck (E) =
det(iF/2π) and cj (E) = 0 for j > k. Therefore cj (E) = 0 for j > k where k is the rank of
the bundle E.
Remark 1.18. When the complex bundle E is the holomorphic tangent bundle T (1,0) M, we
say that ck (E) is the Chern class of the manifold M and usually denote it simply by ck (M)
or ck .
It is useful for computations to have explicit formulae for the Chern classes. One can
show that (see [20]):

where [. . .] denotes the cohomology class.
We now give an alternative description of Chern classes that is useful in understanding
their topological meaning, using cycles.4 Let E be a rank r complex vector bundle on a
manifold M of complex dimension m. Let s1 , . . . , sr be r global sections of E (not necessarily
holomorphic). Define Dk to be the locus of points where the first k sections develop a linear

This description comes from the duality between homology and cohomology. However, we will not
discuss homology in these lectures; see for instance [16, 9] for more information on that topic.

dependence, that is where s1 ∧ . . . ∧ sk = 0 as a section of Λk E. Then the cycles Dk
are Poincaré dual to the Chern classes cr+1−k (see section 3.3.3 for a definition of Poincaré
duality, and [16] for a more general discussion). Thus we can use the cycles Dk to understand
the topological meaning of the Chern classes cr+1−k . For instance, the Chern class c1 (E)
corresponds to the cycle Dr , which is defined by s1 ∧ . . . ∧ sr = 0. This represents the zeroes
of the sections of the determinant line bundle Λr E (see section 1.6); therefore c1 (E) = 0 is
the same thing as Λr E being trivial. Indeed, c1 (E) = c1 (Λr E). For k = 1, we find that
the top Chern class cr (E) is represented by the zeros of a single section of E. In particular,
if E = T (1,0) M, then cm (M) represents the zeros of a generic section of the holomorphic
tangent bundle; and the integral of the top Chern class over M gives the Euler characteristic
of M:

χ=
cm (M).

1.5.1

Properties of Chern classes — and a digression on exact sequences

Chern classes also have a few important properties that are useful in practical calculations.
To state some of them, let us first introduce the notion of (short) exact sequences, which is
omnipresent in algebraic geometry.
A sequence of spaces and maps

such that Im(αk ) = Ker(αk+1 ) for all k is called an exact sequence. In particular, 0 → A −
→B
β

means that α is injective, while B −
→ C → 0 means that β is surjective.
If the exact sequence has the form
α

β

0→A−
→B−
→ C → 0,

(1.26)

we call it a short exact sequence. From the definition above it is easy to see that a short
exact sequence is equivalent to saying that A ⊆ B and that C = B/A. We say that the
sequence splits if B = A ⊕ C. Hence, one can understand the space B in the short exact
sequence (1.26) as a deformation of the direct sum A ⊕ C.
Remark 1.19. When I first learned about exact sequences I found it easier to understand
these definitions pictorially; hence I reproduce in figure 2 my schematic visualizations of
these abstract definitions. They may or may not be useful to the reader, but well here they
are. :-)
Now let V be the direct sum bundle E ⊕ F . Then the total Chern class of V is c(V ) =
c(E) ∧ c(F ), which follows from properties of the determinant. In fact, this property is (in
an appropriate sense) ‘deformation independent’, and c(V ) = c(E) ∧ c(F ) holds whenever
0 → E → V → F → 0 is a short exact sequence.

from this picture it is easy to see that giving a short exact sequence, as in the second picture,
is equivalent to saying that A ⊆ B and C = B/A.

1.5.2

Chern character

To end this section we quickly define the Chern character, which will be useful in computations of Chern classes later on. Suppose that we define the classes xi intrinsically by
Q
c(E) = ri=1 (1 + xi ), where r is the rank of the bundle E. Then the Chern character ch(E)
P
is defined by ch(E) = i exi . The first few terms in the expansion of the exponential are

1

ch(E) = r + c1 (E) + (c1 (E)2 − 2c2 (E)) + (c1 (E)3 − 3c1 (E)c2 (E) + 3c3 (E)) + . . . . (1.27)

Note that the Chern character satisfies the useful identities ch(E ⊕ F ) = ch(E) + ch(F ) and
ch(E ⊗ F ) = ch(E)ch(F ).

1.6

Holomorphic vector bundles

So far we have met complex vector bundles over complex manifolds. We will now formally
define holomorphic vector bundles over complex manifolds.
Definition 1.20. Let M be a complex manifold. Let {Ep } : p ∈ M be a family of complex
vector spaces of dimension k, parameterized by M. Let E be the total space of this family,
and π : E → M be the natural projection. Suppose also that E has the structure of a
complex manifold. E with its complex structure is called a holomorphic vector bundle with

fiber Ck if the map π is a holomorphic map of complex manifolds5 and for each p there exists
an open neighborhood U ⊂ M and a biholomorphic map φU : π −1 (U) → U × Ck such that
for each u ∈ U the map φU takes Eu to {u} × Ck , and this is an isomorphism between Eu
and Ck as complex vector spaces. k is called the rank of the bundle; it is the dimension of
its fibers.

Basically, the important points in the definition are that the total space E has the
structure of a complex manifold, the projection map π is a holomorphic map of complex
manifolds, and the trivialization φU is a biholormophism. This is not always obvious, and
not all complex vector bundles are holomorphic vector bundles.
5
Let f : M → N , and M and N be complex manifolds with complex dimensions m and n. Take a point p
in a chart (U, φ) of M . Let (V, ψ) be a chart of N such that f (p) ∈ V . Let {zµ } = φ(p) and {wν } = ψ(f (p))
be their coordinates in Cm and Cn . We thus have a map ψ ◦ f ◦ φ−1 : Cm → Cn . If each function wν is
a holomorphic function of zµ , we say that f is a holomorphic map. A map f is called biholomorphic if an
inverse map f −1 : N → M exists and both f and f −1 are holomorphic maps. See figure 4 for a pictorial
description of holomorphic maps of complex manifolds.

1.6 Holomorphic vector bundles

18

Let us now give a few examples of holomorphic vector bundles. The simplest holomorphic
vector bundle is M × Ck , which is called the trivial vector bundle over M.
The complexified tangent and cotangent bundles also admit natural complex structures,
which make them into holomorphic vector bundles.
Now what about the complex vector bundles Λp,q M? It turns out that, although these
bundles all have complex vector spaces as fibers, only the bundles with q = 0 are holomorphic
vector bundles. A holomorphic section of Λp,0 M is called a holomorphic p-form.
1.6.1

Holomorphic line bundles

If the fiber of a holomorphic vector bundle is C, i.e. its rank is one, then we say that it is a
holomorphic line bundle. As an example, the bundle KM = Λm,0 M on a complex manifold
M of complex dimension m, sections of which are (m, 0)-forms, is a holomorphic line bundle,
usually called the canonical bundle. Its sections are sometimes called holomorphic volume
forms on M. Actually, given any holomorphic vector bundle E of rank r, we can form the
holomorphic line bundle Λr E, the determinant line bundle, whose transition functions are
the determinants of those for E.
Given two line bundle L and L′ over M, one can construct many other line bundles.
First, there is the dual line bundle L∗ to L. But also, any tensor product of line bundles is
also a line bundle, so L ⊗ L′ forms a new line bundle. This is so because if we look at the
fibers, they are one-dimensional vector spaces; but we have that dim(U ⊗ V ) = dim U dim V
for vector spaces U and V , so we see that the fibers of L ⊗ L′ also have dimension one,
therefore L ⊗ L′ is a line bundle. In fact, the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line
bundles over M form an abelian group, where multiplication is given by the tensor product,
inverses are dual bundles, and the identity is the trivial line bundle L ⊗ L∗ . This group is
called the Picard group of M.
Now let us consider the special case where M is CPm . First, there is the natural line
bundle whose fiber over a point l in CPm is the line it represents in Cm+1 ; this is the tautological line bundle (also called the universal line bundle), which we denote by L−1 . Its dual,
which we denote by L, is called the hyperplane line bundle. In fact, since the tensor product
of two holomorphic line bundles is always a holomorphic line bundle, we can construct holomorphic line bundles Lk over CPm for any k ∈ Z. Actually, it can even be shown that every
holomorphic line bundle over CPm is isomorphic to Lk for some k ∈ Z. For instance, the
canonical bundle KCPm is isomorphic to L−m−1 . By abuse of notation, we usually denote the
line bundle Lk by O(k), although technically O(k) denotes the sheaf of holomorphic sections
of Lk . It is interesting to note that for k ≥ 0 the vector space of holomorphic sections
Γ(Lk ) is canonically identified with the set of homogeneous polynomials of degree k in CPm .
Therefore, homogeneous coordinates of CPm are sections of the hyperplane line bundle L.
We will come back to this correspondence in the next subsection.

1.7 Divisors and line bundles

1.6.2

Refined Dolbeault cohomology groups

Finally, we can use these results to refine our definition of the Dolbeault cohomology groups
on complex manifolds. First, we must generalize our definition of a k-form. We defined
k-forms as sections of the bundle Λk M, that is they take values in M. We can now define
an E-valued k-form ω, that is a form that takes values in the vector bundle E, by the map
ω : E → E ⊗ Λk M. Thus ω is a section of E ⊗ Λk M. For instance, we could define a
Λp,0M-valued (0, q)-form ω : Λp,0 M → Λp,0 M ⊗ Λ0,q M; hence ω is a section of Λp,q M, that is
ω is simply what we previously defined as a (p, q)-form. But using this generalized definition
we can consider forms taking values in complex vector bundles E different from Λp,0M.
We defined the (p, q) Dolbeault cohomology group as the quotient of the vector space
¯
¯
of ∂-closed (p, q)-forms by the vector space of ∂-exact
(p, q)-forms. However, the operator
∂¯ only acts on the ‘anti-holomorphic’ piece of a (p, q)-form, i.e. on the (0, 1) part of the
decomposition of the Λp,q M bundle. Therefore, we can look at the elements of the Dolbeault
¯
cohomology groups in the following way; they are ∂-closed
(0, q)-forms taking values in the
p,0
holomorphic vector bundle Λ M. From that point of view, we can define the cohomology
groups H∂q¯(Λp,0M), where Λp,0 M is a holomorphic vector bundle, sections of which are (p, 0)forms. These cohomology groups are indeed isomorphic to the Dolbeault cohomology groups
previously defined. However, they can be generalized; since ∂¯ commutes with holomorphic
transition functions, ∂¯ may now act on forms taking values in any holomorphic vector bundle
E, not just the holomorphic vector bundle Λp,0M. This leads to the following generalized
definition of Dolbeault cohomology.
Definition 1.21. Let M be a complex manifold, and E a holomorphic vector bundle on M.
We have the complex
∂¯

→ Γ(E) ⊗ Ω0,m (M) −
→ ... −
→ Γ(E) ⊗ Ω0,1 (M) −
0 → Γ(E) −

(1.28)

We define the Dolbeault cohomology groups taking values in E, H∂q¯(E), by
H∂q¯(E) =

Ker(∂¯ : Γ(E) ⊗ Ω0,q (M) → Γ(E) ⊗ Ω0,q+1 (M))
.
Im(∂¯ : Γ(E) ⊗ Ω0,q−1 (M) → Γ(E) ⊗ Ω0,q (M))

(1.29)

This definition reduces to the former definition of Dolbeault cohomology groups when
E = Λp,0 M.

1.7

Divisors and line bundles

To end this section, we explore the connection between line bundles and divisors, which are
important objects in algebraic geometry and in its physical applications. In practice, it is
convenient to be able to think of divisors in terms of line bundles and vice-versa. For more
on that topic see [15].

20

Definition 1.22. Let M be a complex manifold. Let N be an hypersurface, that is a
codimension 1 submanifold that can be written locally as the zero locus of an holomorphic
function. Moreover, let N be irreducible, that is it cannot be written as the union of
two hypersurfaces. Then we define a divisor to be the formal finite sum of irreducible
P
hypersurfaces D = i ni Ni with integer coefficients ni . A divisor is called effective if ni ≥ 0
for all i.
Now in which way is this object related to line bundles?
Let L be a holomorphic line bundle over M, and s a nonzero holomorphic section of L.
Let N be the hypersurface defined by N = {m ∈ M : s(m) = 0}. Then N may be written
in a unique way as a union N = ∪i Ni , where Ni are irreducible hypersurfaces. For each i,
there is a unique positive integer ai which tells us the order to which s vanishes along Ni .
P
Define D = i ai Ni . Then D is an effective divisor. In fact, since the divisors constructed
that way from line bundles are equal if and only if the line bundles are isomorphic, there
is a bijection between effective divisors on M and isomorphism classes of holomorphic line
bundles equipped with nonzero holomorphic sections.
If we now consider holomorphic line bundles with a nonzero meromorphic6 section, then
P
the divisor D = i ai Ni corresponds to a section s with a zero of order ai along Ni if ai > 0,
and a pole of order −ai along Ni if ai < 0. Thus there is a bijection between divisors on M
and isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles equipped with nonzero meromorphic
sections.

2

Kähler geometry

We will now consider a special type of complex manifolds, namely Kähler manifolds. Roughly
speaking, manifolds with a Kähler metric are those for which the parallel transport of a
holomorphic vector remains holomorphic.

2.1

Kähler manifolds

Definition 2.1. Let (M, J) be a complex manifold, and let g be a Riemannian metric on
M. We call g a Hermitian metric if the three following equivalent conditions hold:
1. g(v, w) = g(Jv, Jw) for all vector fields v, w on M;
6

A meromorphic function is a function that is holomorphic on an open subset of the complex number plane
C except at points in a set of isolated poles, which are certain well-behaved singularities. Every meromorphic
function can be expressed as the ratio between two holomorphic functions (with the denominator not constant
0): the poles then occur at the zeroes of the denominator.

2.1 Kähler manifolds

21

2. In component notation, gab = Jac Jbd gcd ;
3. Using the greek indices notation, gab = gαβ̄ + gᾱβ , that is gαβ = gᾱβ̄ = 0.
In other words, a Hermitian metric is a positive-definite inner product T (1,0) M⊗T (0,1) M →
C at every point on a complex manifold M. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to show
that the three above conditions are equivalent.
Remark 2.2. Note that this is a restriction on the metric, not on the manifold M, since it
can be shown that a complex manifold always admits a Hermitian metric.
Using this Hermitian metric g, we can define a two-form ω on M called the Hermitian
form by ω(v, w) = g(Jv, w) for all vector fields on v, w on M. The equivalent definition in
terms of real components is ωab = Jac gcb , while in terms of complex components it is given
by ωab = igαβ̄ − igᾱβ . Therefore, ω is a (1, 1)-form.
If g was not Hermitian, then ω would not be a form (that is it would not be antisymmetric). In fact, the Hermitian condition is equivalent to the condition ωab = −ωba .
Definition 2.3. Let (M, J) be a complex manifold, and g a Hermitian metric on M, with
Hermitian form ω. g is a Kähler metric if dω = 0. In this case we call ω a Kähler form, and
we call a complex manifold (M, J) endowed with a Kähler metric a Kähler manifold.
In the remaining of this section we will explore properties of Kähler manifolds. First,
it can be shown that locally, the Kähler condition dω = 0 is equivalent to the condition
∂µ gν ᾱ = ∂ν gµᾱ and its conjugate equation ∂ρ̄ gµᾱ = ∂ᾱ gµρ̄ . Moreover, for a Kähler metric
g the Levi-Civita connection has no mixed indices, meaning that vectors with holomorphic
indices remain with holomorphic indices after parallel transportation. Hence, for Kähler
manifolds parallel transport preserves holomorphicity. This implies a restriction on the
holonomy of Kähler manifolds, as we will see in section 2.4.
An important consequence of Kählerity is the existence of a Kähler potential. Let φ be
a real smooth function on M. Clearly, ddc φ is a closed real two-form, as both d an dc are
¯ ddc φ is also a closed (1, 1)-form.
real operators. But since ddc = 2i∂ ∂,
In fact, any closed (1, 1)-form ω can be expressed locally as ω = ddc φ for a real smooth
function φ on M. This is however not true globally; it only holds if ω is also exact.
Therefore, it is always possible to express the Kähler form ω in terms of a smooth function
φ locally, and we call this function the Kähler potential. This also follows from the Kähler
condition in component notation given above. However this is not true globally, for the
following reason.
Let M be a compact manifold of real dimension 2m, with Kähler form ω. Since ω is
closed, it defines a Dolbeault cohomology class [ω] ∈ H∂1,1
¯ (M), or a de Rham cohomology
2
class [ω] ∈ HdR
(M, R). The latter is usually called the Kähler class. Further, the wedge

2.2 Forms on Kähler manifolds

22

product of m copies of ω, denoted by ω m , is proportional to the volume form of g (one can

Therefore
it defines a non-trivial element in both H∂m,m

that M ω ∝ vol(M). But for a compact manifold M, vol(M) > 0, and M ω only depends
on the cohomology class [ω] (by Stoke’s theorem). Thus, [ω] must be non-zero. However,
ddc φ is exact and therefore zero as a cohomology class. It follows that on a compact Kähler
manifold it is impossible to find a globally defined Kähler potential.
However, an interesting result is that we can parameterize Kähler metrics with a fixed
Kähler class by smooth functions on the manifold. This goes as follows. Let ω and ω ′ be
two different Kähler forms in the same Kähler class. Therefore, ω − ω ′ is an exact form.
But we saw that exact forms can be expressed globally as ddc φ for a smooth function φ.
Therefore, globally we have that ω = ω ′ + ddc φ. Moreover, φ is unique up to the addition
of a constant; suppose φ1 and φ2 are two different such functions, then ddc (φ1 − φ2 ) = 0 on
M, which implies that φ1 − φ2 is constant, as M is compact. Therefore, smooth functions
on M parameterize the set of Kähler forms in a particular Kähler class.
Example 2.4. In this example we sketch the proof that CPm is a Kähler manifold, that
P
2
is it admits a Kähler metric. Consider the function u(z0 , . . . , zm ) = m
µ=0 |zµ | where zµ ,
µ = 0, . . . , m are homogeneous coordinates on Cm+1 \{0}. Define a (1, 1)-form α by α =
ddc (log u). α cannot be the Kähler form of any metric on Cm+1 \{0}, since it is not positive.
However, if we consider the projection π : Cm+1 \{0} → CPm defined by π : (z0 , . . . , zm ) 7→
[z0 , . . . , zm ], one can show that there exists a unique positive (1, 1)-form ω on CPm such
that α = π ∗ (ω). ω is a Kähler form on CPm ; its associated Kähler metric is called the
Fubini-Study metric, and is given in components by gµν̄ = ∂µ ∂ν̄ log u.
There is a general result that says that any submanifolds of a Kähler manifold is also
Kähler (since the restriction of the Kähler form to a complex submanifold is also a closed,
positive (1, 1)-form). We just saw that CPm is Kähler; therefore all its submanifolds are also
Kähler. This important family of complex manifolds was constructed in section 1.1; we now
know that they all admit a Kähler metric.

2.2

Forms on Kähler manifolds

A complex manifold with a Kähler metric has now enough structure to define operators
analog to the Hodge star and the d† and ∆d operators on a Riemannian manifold, thus
leading to a Hodge theory on Kähler manifolds. We can also relate this theory to the real
version — since complex manifolds are also real manifolds — and find additional properties
of Kähler manifolds.
Before doing so let us summarize quickly some results for real manifolds.

2.2 Forms on Kähler manifolds

23

Let M be a compact Riemannian n-manifold, with metric g. Let α and β be k-forms
on M. We define the pointwise inner product of α and β by (in component notation)

(α, β) = αa1 ...ak βb1 ...bk g a1 b1 . . . g ak bk . We define a second inner product, called
R the L inner
product, using the volume form dVg on M given by the metric, by hα, βi = M (α, β)dVg .
The Hodge star is an isomorphism of vector bundles ∗ : Λk T ∗ M → Λn−k T ∗ M such that
if β is a k-form on M, then ∗β is the unique (n − k)-form satisfying α ∧ (∗β) = (α, β)dVg for
all k-forms α on M.

We define an operator d† : Ωk (M) → Ωk−1 (M) by d† β = (−1)kn+n+1 ∗ d(∗β). It is
sometimes called the formal adjoint of d. We have that (d† )2 = 0, so we say that a form
satisfying d† α is coclosed, and if α = d† β then it is coexact. We also define the Laplacian
∆d = dd† + d† d. If a form satisfies ∆d α = 0, we say that it is harmonic. It can be shown
easily that a form on a compact manifold M is harmonic if and only if it is closed and
coclosed.
Now, let Hk be the vector space of harmonic k-forms on M. The Hodge decomposition
theorem states that Ωk (M) = Hk ⊕Im(dk−1)⊕Im(d†k+1 ), that is every k-form can be expressed
uniquely as a sum of an harmonic form, an exact form and a coexact form. Moreover, we
have that Ker(dk ) = Hk ⊕ Im(dk−1 ) and Ker(d†k ) = Hk ⊕ Im(d†k+1), that is closed (resp.
coclosed) forms can be expressed uniquely as a sum of an harmonic and an exact (resp.
k
coexact) form. Therefore, since HdR
(M, R) = Ker(dk )/Im(dk−1), we see that there is an
k
k
isomorphism between H and HdR (M, R). In other words, every de Rham cohomology class
on M contains a unique harmonic representative. However, although cohomology classes are
topological invariants of M, their harmonic representatives depend on a particular choice of
a metric g.
We are now ready to see what the analogs of these constructions are on Kähler manifolds.
Let M be a complex manifold or real dimension 2m, with a Kähler metric g. Let α and
β be complex k-forms on M. First, define a pointwise inner product (in real component
notation) by (α, β) = αa1 ...ak βb1 ...bk g a1 b1 . . . g ak bk , that is (α, β) is a complex function on M,
which
is bilinear in α and β̄. For a compact M, define the L2 inner product by hα, βi =
R
(α, β)dVg . hα, βi is a complex number, bilinear in α and β̄.
M
Let the Hodge star on Kähler manifolds be the isomorphism of complex vector bundles
∗ : Λk TC∗ M → Λ2m−k TC∗ M such that if β is a complex k-form on M, then ∗β is the unique
complex (2m − k)-form satisfying α ∧ (∗β) = (α, β)dVg for all complex k-forms α. Define
the following operators taking complex k-forms to complex (k − 1)-forms (there is no (−1)
factor as in the real analog since the real dimension of a complex manifold is always even):
d† = − ∗ d(∗α),

∂ † = − ∗ ∂(∗α),

¯
∂¯† = − ∗ ∂(∗α).

(2.1)

We also define the usual Laplacian ∆d = dd† + d† d, and the two Laplacians ∆∂ = ∂∂ † + ∂ † ∂
¯ which satisfy ∆∂ = ∆∂¯ = 1 ∆d . Reformulating in terms of holomorphic
and ∆∂¯ = ∂¯∂¯† + ∂¯† ∂,

and anti-holomorphic parts, we have defined the following operators on Kähler manifolds:
∗ : Ωp,q (M) → Ωm−p,m−q (M);
∂ : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp+1,q (M), ∂¯ : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp,q+1 (M);
∂ † : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp−1,q (M), ∂¯† : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp,q−1(M);
∆∂¯ : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp,q (M).

∆∂ : Ωp,q (M) → Ωp,q (M),

Remark 2.5. In the literature the ∂-Laplacian
∆∂¯ on a Kähler manifold is often simply called
the Laplacian and denoted by ∆. Similarly, we call a (p, q)-form satisfying ∆∂¯ an harmonic
¯ = ∂ † α = ∂¯† α = 0.
(p, q)-form. A (p, q)-form α is harmonic if and only if ∂α = ∂α
How can we define the Hodge theory of a Kähler manifold? In fact, we can formulate a
Hodge theory for the ∂¯ operator which is very similar to the Hodge theory for real manifolds.
Let Hp,q be the vector space of harmonic (p, q)-forms. The following decompositions hold:




Ωp,q (M) = Hp,q ⊕ ∂¯ Ωp,q−1 (M) ⊕ ∂¯† Ωp,q+1(M) ,


Ker∂¯ = Hp,q ⊕ ∂¯ Ωp,q−1 (M) ,


Ker∂¯† = Hp,q ⊕ ∂¯† Ωp,q+1 (M) .
(2.3)

We see that the vector space of harmonic (p, q)-forms is isomorphic to the Dolbeault cop,q
homology groups, that is Hp,q ∼
= H∂¯ (M). This means that there is a unique harmonic
representative in each Dolbeault cohomology classes.

Let us now define HCk to be the vector space of complex harmonic k-forms (with respect to
∆d ), that is HCk = Ker ∆d : ΩkC (M) → ΩkC (M) . Using (1.11), and the fact that 21 ∆d = ∆∂¯,
we see that there is a further decomposition
HCk =

of complex harmonic k-forms into a sum of harmonic (p, q)-forms with p+q = k. By the above
isomorphisms, we learn that for a Kähler manifold, the complexified de Rham cohomology
decomposes into the Dolbeault cohomology (note that the de Rham cohomology groups are

Note that this is true because dimC HdR

Furthermore, since by the above properties b2k−1 = j=0
2k−1
have that b
is even for 1 ≤ k ≤ m. In practice, this last condition is useful to deduce that
some complex manifolds do not admit a Kähler metric. For example, the manifold S 3 × S 1
has a complex structure, but it does not admit a Kähler metric since b1 = 1.
It would be interesting to understand what the Hodge numbers of a Kähler manifold
exactly mean in terms of geometry. To end this subsection, let us make a first step towards
this goal by defining the Kähler cone.
Definition 2.6. Let (M, J) be a complex manifold admitting Kähler metrics. If g is a
Kähler metric on M, then the Kähler form ω is a closed (1, 1)-form, that is [ω] ∈ H∂1,1
¯ (M).
1,1
We define the Kähler cone K of M to be the set of cohomology classes [ω] ∈ H∂¯ (M) such
that ω is the Kähler form of a Kähler metric on M.
In other words, the Kähler cone defines the set of possible Kähler forms on M. This
points towards the fact that the Hodge number h1,1 (M) is intimately related to the Kähler
structure moduli space of M; we will come back to this in the next section.

2.4

Holonomy

Before we close this section, let us find what the holonomy of a Kähler manifold is. We
have not discussed holonomy of manifolds so far, but they are crucial in the definition of
Calabi–Yau manifolds. Let us first recall what the holonomy of a manifold is.
Definition 2.7. Let M be an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with metric g and affine
connection ∇. Let p be a point in M and consider the set of closed loops at p, {c(t)|0 ≤ t ≤
1, c(0) = c(1) = p}. Take a vector X in Tp M and parallel transport along a closed curve c(t);
we end up with a new vector Xc ∈ Tp M. Thus, the loop c(t) and the connection ∇ induce a
linear transformation Pc : Tp M → Tp M. The set of all these transformations is denoted by
Holp (M) and called the holonomy group at p.

26

The holonomy group measures how vectors are transformed by parallel transport around
a closed curve at a point p of M. In fact, holonomy groups can be defined more generally
for a vector bundle E with a connection, not necessarily the tangent bundle with its affine
connection; the reader is referred to [18] for a detailed discussion of holonomy.
Note that Holp (M) must be a subgroup of GL(n, R), which is the maximal holonomy
group possible. Holp (M) is trivial if and only if the Riemann tensor vanishes.
Now, suppose that M is connected (which we always assume in these lectures), and
that p and q are two points of M connected by a curve a. The curve a defines a map
τa : Tp M → Tq M by parallel transporting a vector in Tp M to Tq M along a. Then the
holonomy groups are related by Holp (M) = τa−1 Holq (M)τa , hence Holq (M) is isomorphic to
Holp (M). For that reason, the holonomy group Holp (M) is independent of the base point p,
and we usually omit the subscript p and denote by Hol(M) the holonomy group of a manifold
M.
In particular, if M is a Riemaniann manifold and ∇ is a metric connection, then parallel
transport preserves the length of a vector, which implies that the holonomy group must be
a subgroup of SO(n) (if M is orientable).
Now what is the holonomy of a complex manifold with a Kähler metric?
Proposition 2.8. Let M be a complex manifold of real dimension 2m, with a Kähler metric
g. The holonomy group of M is contained in U(m).
(1,0)

Take a vector X ∈ Tp M in the holomorphic tangent space at a point p of M. We saw
in section 2.1 that for an affine connection ∇ corresponding to a Kähler metric, vectors with
holomorphic indices remain with holomorphic indices after parallel transport. Therefore, if
Xc is the vector resulting from parallel transporting X around a closed loop c, we must have
(1,0)
Xc ∈ Tp M. Moreover, ∇ preserves the length of a vector. This implies that the holonomy
(1,0)
(1,0)
group is the set of all transformations Pc : Tp M → Tp M which preserve the length of
a vector, which is (a subgroup of) U(m).
Note that we can use proposition 2.8 as a definition of Kähler manifolds; all the above
properties of Kähler manifolds follow from it.

Calabi–Yau geometry

We are now ready to investigate Calabi–Yau manifolds, which are a particular kind of Kähler
manifolds.
It was in 1954 that Calabi stated his conjecture [7, 8], which was proved by Yau in 1976
[24, 25]. Given a compact Kähler manifold M with c1 = 0, the proof of the conjecture

3.1 Calabi–Yau manifolds

27

guarantees the existence of a Ricci-flat Kähler metric on M, that is a Kähler metric with
zero Ricci form. Such a manifold is called a Calabi–Yau manifold.
However, many different definitions of Calabi–Yau manifolds exist in the literature; we
will review some of the most common definitions and study some relations among them. We
will also investigate properties of Calabi–Yau manifolds and study in details a few examples.
We will end this section by quickly describing ‘local’ Calabi–Yau manifolds (i.e. noncompact
Calabi–Yau manifolds), which have many applications for instance in topological strings and
Gromov–Witten theory.
Calabi–Yau manifolds have been studied extensively in the recent decades, particularly
because of their importance in string theory. While the mathematical study of Calabi–Yau
manifolds has helped us understand compactifications of string theory, the study of string
theory has led to fascinating insights in the geometry of Calabi–Yau manifolds, for example
the study of the Calabi–Yau moduli space and mirror symmetry. Calabi–Yau manifolds are
thus a very good example of the fruitful interactions between mathematics and physics that
have been taking place in the recent decades.

3.1

Calabi–Yau manifolds

Let us first list some of the most common definitions of Calabi–Yau manifolds. A Calabi–Yau
manifold of real dimension 2m is a compact Kähler manifold (M, J, g):
1. with zero Ricci form,
2. with vanishing first Chern class,
3. with Hol(g) = SU(m) (or Hol(g) ⊆ SU(m)),
4. with trivial canonical bundle,
5. that admits a globally defined and nowhere vanishing holomorphic m-form.
We now describe some of the relations between these definitions. There are many ways
to understand these relations. We only describe a few relations, but many others can be
found in the references at the end of these lecture notes.
[1-2]
First, let us show that a compact Ricci-flat Kähler manifold has c1 = 0. We saw in (1.23)

that the first Chern class of a complex vector bundle E over M is given by c1 (E) = 2πi Tr F ,
where F is the curvature of a connection A. The first Chern class of a manifold was defined
in section 1.5 to be the first Chern class of the holomorphic tangent bundle, and in this case,

3.1 Calabi–Yau manifolds

28

the curvature two-form F is simply −iR, where R is the Ricci two-form. Therefore, given a
Kähler manifold M, its first Chern class is given by


1
Tr R .
(3.1)
c1 (M) =
2π
In other words, the Ricci form defines the first Chern class of a manifold. Hence it is clear
that if a Kähler manifold admits a Ricci-flat metric then it has c1 = 0. However, the
converse, namely, does a Kähler manifold with c1 = 0 admit a Ricci-flat metric, is much
more complicated to prove. It was conjectured by Calabi that the answer is yes and that the
Ricci-flat metric is unique; uniqueness was proved by Calabi, existence by Yau twenty years
later. More precisely, it was proved that given a complex manifold M with a Kähler metric
g, a Kähler form ω and c1 = 0, then there exists a unique Ricci-flat metric g ′ whose Kähler
form ω ′ is in the same Kähler class as ω. In other words, there is a unique Ricci-flat Kähler
metric in each Kähler class of M. This means that the Ricci-flat Kähler metrics on M form
a smooth family of dimension h1,1 (M), isomorphic to the Kähler cone of M. A proof of this
deep theorem is given in chapter 5 of [18].
Therefore, h1,1 (M) counts the number of possible Ricci-flat Kähler forms on a Calabi–
Yau manifold M. These are sometimes called the Kähler parameters of M. Moreover, as any
element in a class in H∂1,1
¯ (M) can be used to deform the Ricci-flat Kähler form slightly while
preserving Kählerity, we can also say that h1,1 (M) classifies infinitesimal Kähler deformations
of the metric.
[4-5]
We saw that the canonical bundle of a complex manifold M of real dimension 2m is
the complex vector bundle KM = Λm,0 M, that is its sections are (m, 0)-forms. Triviality of
this bundle implies that the total space of KM is given by M × C (since it is a line bundle).
Therefore, corresponding to the unit section M ×{1}, that is the constant function 1, there is
a globally defined and nowhere vanishing holomorphic (m, 0)-form Ω, which is usually called
the holomorphic volume form. Moreover, it is clear that any globally defined (m, 0)-form
can be written as f Ω for some function f on M. But, if M is compact and the form is
holomorphic, f must be holomorphic, and the extension of the maximum modulus principle
of complex analysis tells us that f is constant. Hence hm,0 = 1. On the other hand, the
existence of a globally defined and nowhere vanishing holomorphic (m, 0)-form α directly
implies that the canonical bundle is trivial.
[2-4]
The canonical bundle is the determinant line bundle of the holomorphic cotangent bundle,
i.e. it is the highest antisymmetric tensor product of the holomorphic cotangent bundle. We
saw in section 1.5 that c1 (E) = 0 is the same thing as the determinant line bundle Λk E
being trivial, where k is the rank of E. Therefore KM = Λm T ∗(1,0) M is trivial if and only if
c1 (T ∗(1,0) M) = −c1 (T (1,0) M) = −c1 = 0.

3.2 Cohomology

29

[1-3]
We now show that if M is a Ricci-flat Kähler manifold of real dimension 2m, then its
holonomy group is contained in SU(m). Let V = V k ∂k ∈ Tp M be a tangent vector, and
parallel transport it along an infinitesimal parallelogram of area δamn with edges that are
parallel to the vectors ∂m and ∂n . It is a standard result that
V ′k = V k + δamn Rmn k l V l .

(3.2)

The matrices δlk + δamn Rmn k l are the elements of the holonomy group that are infinitesimally
close to the identity. For a Kähler metric, the matrices δamn Rmn k l are in the Lie algebra
of U(m). In fact, in a neighborhood of the identity we have that U(m) ∼
= SU(m) × U(1),
k
mn
where the U(1) factor is generated by the trace δa Rmn k . One can easily show that this
is equal to −4δaµν̄ Rµν̄ . Therefore, if the metric is Ricci-flat, then the U(1) part of the
holonomy vanishes, and the holonomy groups must be contained in SU(m). The converse
is also true; if the holonomy of a Kähler manifold is contained in SU(m), then its Kähler
metric is Ricci-flat.
In fact, we have only shown that this is true for simply connected manifolds, that is for
closed curves that can be continuously shrunk to a point. The equivalence still holds for
multiply connected manifolds, but the proof is more involved.

3.2

Cohomology

The Hodge numbers of a Calabi–Yau manifold satisfy a few more properties, which drastically
decrease the number of undetermined Hodge numbers. We will now focus on Calabi–Yau
threefolds, that is Calabi–Yau manifolds with complex dimension 3, for the sake of brevity.
These are the most important Calabi–Yau manifolds in string theory applications. But most
results extend straighforwardly to higher dimensional Calabi–Yau manifolds.
We have already shown that the Hodge numbers of Kähler manifolds satisfy a Hodge
star duality hp,q = h3−q,3−p and a complex conjugation duality hp,q = hq,p . For Calabi–Yau
manifolds, there is a further duality, sometimes called holomorphic duality. We have shown
in the previous section that triviality of the canonical bundle of a Calabi–Yau manifold M
of real dimension 6 implies that h3,0 = 1, i.e. the existence of a unique holomorphic volume
form Ω. Given
(0, 3 − q) cohomology class
R a (0, q) cohomology class [α], there is a unique 0,q
[β] such that M α ∧ β ∧ Ω = 1 (using Stoke’s theorem). Thus h = h0,3−q . Therefore, for a
Calabi–Yau manifold we have that h3,0 = h0,3 = h0,0 = h3,3 = 1.
Moreover, one can show that h1,0 = 0 [18, 17]. Thus, h1,0 = h0,1 = h0,2 = h2,0 = h2,3 =
h3,2 = h3,1 = h1,3 = 0. Therefore, the only remaining independent Hodge numbers are h1,1

that is
χ = 2(h1,1 − h2,1 ).
(3.4)
Therefore, if the Euler characteristic is easily computed, we only have to compute one of
the two independent Hodge numbers to get all the topological information. In fact, we saw
in section 1.5 that the Euler characteristic is given by the integral over M of the top Chern
class of M, which is c3 (M) for a Calabi–Yau threefold:
Z
χ=
c3 (M).
(3.5)
M

This formula can be used to compute the Euler characteristic of M.
We saw earlier that h1,1 classifies infinitesimal deformations of the Kähler structure. For
a Calabi–Yau threefold, similarly, h2,1 classifies infinitesimal deformations of the complex
structure. We refer the reader to chapter 6 of [16] for a detailed discussion of this interpretation and of the moduli space of Calabi–Yau manifolds.
Remark 3.1. One of the fascinating property of Calabi–Yau threefolds is that they come
in mirror pairs, (M, W ), such that H 2,1 (W ) ∼
= H 2,1 (M). Roughly
= H 1,1 (M) and H 1,1 (W ) ∼
speaking, the complex structure moduli is exchanged with the Kähler structure moduli. This
is the basic idea behind mirror symmetry. See [16, 10] for more information on this subject.

3.3

Examples

We will now study in some details two particular examples of Calabi–Yau threefolds: the
quintic in CP4 , and the Tian-Yau manifold. Both examples have been very important in
the history of string theory, and they will help us find our way in the asbtract jungle of
Calabi–Yau threefolds.
There are various ways one can follow to see if a Kähler manifold is Calabi–Yau. The more
‘hands-on’ way is probably to find a globally defined and nowhere vanishing holomorphic

3.3 Examples

31

volume form (see for instance chapter 9 of [9] for this approach). Another approach, more
abstract, is to compute explicitely the first Chern class of the manifolds and see that it
vanishes. In our two examples, we will first follow the latter, as in the process we will
learn how to compute Chern classes. Then we will quickly review how to construct the
holomorphic volume form.
Through these two examples we will study in more generality complete intersection manifolds in complex projective spaces and products thereof. But to start with we need to know
the Chern classes of the complex projective spaces CPm .
Obviously we cannot prove here all the results that are needed to carry on the computations. The reader is referred to [17] for a detailed discussion of various constructions of
Calabi–Yau threefolds.
3.3.1

Chern classes of CPm

First, we need to compute the total Chern class of CPm . We recall that homogeneous
coordinates zi , i = 0, . . . , m of Cm+1 are sections of the hyperplane line bundle L. Thus, the
holomorphic tangent bundle of Cm+1 is spanned by tangent vectors si (z) ∂z∂ i , where the si are
any sections of L. Now, on CPm , the holomorphic tangent bundle T (1,0) CPm is also spanned
by si (z) ∂z∂ i , with the si any sections of the hyperplane line bundle — which we now denote
rescaling, since
by OCPm (1), but we have to take equivalence classes with respect to overall
L
(m+1)
m
m
to T (1,0) CPm
overall rescaling is trivial in CP . That is, we have a map from OCP (1)
such that its kernel is the trivial line bundle C of multiples of a nowhere-vanishing generator
(z0 , . . . , zm ) 7→ zi ∂z∂ i ∼
= 0 in CPm . This is summarized in the following exact sequence, called
the Euler sequence:
L
(m+1)

0 → C → OCPm (1)

→ T (1,0) CPm → 0.

(3.6)

Trivially c(C)
= 1, so by properties of Chern classes we have that c(CPm ) = c(T (1,0) CPm ) =
L
c(OCPm (1) (m+1) ) = [c(OCPm (1)]m+1 . OCPm (1) is a line bundle, that is its fibers are onedimensional, and so the expansion of the total Chern class is simply c(OCPm (1)) = 1 +
c1 (OCPm (1)). If we let x = c1 (OCPm (1)), we find that
c(CPm ) = (1 + x)m+1 .
3.3.2

(3.7)

Calabi–Yau condition for complete intersection manifolds

We now want to see what the Calabi–Yau condition is for complete intersection manifolds.
But let us first look at Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in complex projective spaces.
Let X be a smooth hypersurface in CPm defined as the zero-locus of a degree d polynomial
p. We can see p as a section of the holomorphic line bundle OCPm (d). Consider T (1,0) X, the

3.3 Examples

32

holomorphic tangent bundle of X. We define the normal bundle NX on X to be the quotient
(1,0) CPm |
X
. As a result, we have the exact sequence 0 → T (1,0) X → T (1,0) CPm |X →
NX = T T (1,0)
X
NX → 0. To convince oneself that this definition of the normal bundle makes sense, one can
visualize it for a one-dimensional hypersurface in CP2 , as in figure 5.
CP2
NX
T (1,0) X
X

Figure 5: Representation of the normal bundle of a one-dimensional hypersurface X in CP2 ,

X
.
which can be understood as the quotient NX = T T (1,0)
X
Now, roughly speaking, on X the section p maps points of X to 0 in the fibers of OCPm (d),
since X is defined as the zero-locus of p. Thus, p serves as a coordinate near X, and in fact the
normal bundle NX of X is simply OCPm (d)|X . This is the crucial point in the computation.
The above exact sequence then becomes (this is also known as the adjunction formula 1; see
[15] for more about this)
0 → T (1,0) X → T (1,0) CPm |X → OCPm (d)|X → 0,

(3.8)

which implies that c(X) = c(CPm )/c(OCPm (d)). OCPm (d) is a line bundle, so c(OCPm (d)) =
1 + c1 (OCPm (d)). We know from above that c(OCPm (1)) = 1 + x. Therefore, its Chern
character is ch(OCPm (1)) = ex . It follows that ch(OCPm (d)) = edx = 1 + c1 (OCPm (d)) + . . .,
hence
(3.9)
c(OCPm (d)) = 1 + dx.
Using these results we find that the Chern class of X is
c(X) =

(1 + x)m+1
.
1 + dx

(3.10)

Since x is a closed two-form, we can expand c(X) in such a way that products of x are
wedge products, from which we can extract the Chern classes ck (X) of X. The first Chern
class is
c1 (X) = [(m + 1) − d]x.
(3.11)
Therefore, we have found an explicit realization of the Calabi–Yau condition for hypersurfaces; the condition c1 = 0 implies a condition on the degree of the polynomial equation,

3.3 Examples

33

d = m + 1. If we want a Calabi–Yau threefold, we have m = 4, and therefore X must be
given by the zero-locus of a degree 5 polynomial, that is a quintic in CP4 .
In fact, it is straightforward to generalize the above computation to complete intersection
manifolds Y given by the zero-locus of a finite number of polynomials in CPm . If there are
l such polynomials of degree di , i = 1, . . . , l, the Chern class is given by
(1 + x)m+1
.
c(Y ) = Ql
i=1 (1 + di x)

Therefore, c1 (Y ) = 0 implies the restriction m + 1 =

There are only five solutions to the above condition, if we are looking for Calabi–Yau
threefolds, that is l = m − 3 — and we assume di ≥ 2, since if one equation has dj = 1 the
manifold defined by the complete intersection in CPm is equivalent to the manifold defined
by the other equations in CPm−1 : the quintic in CP4 , the intersection of two cubics in CP5 ,
the intersection of a quadric and a quartic in CP5 , the intersection of two quadrics and a
cubic in CP6 , and the intersection of four quadrics in CP7 .

This result will be useful for the computation of the Euler characteristic through the integration of the third Chern class over the manifold Y .
3.3.3

The quintic in CP4

We will now concentrate on the quintic Q in CP4 , which is given by a polynomial equation
of degree 5 in the homogeneous coordinates of CP4 . According to the results of the previous
section, we have that
c(Q) = 1 + 10x2 − 40x3 .
(3.14)
To find its Euler characteristic, we must integrate c3 = −40x3 over Q. How do we do that?
We invoke Poincaré duality, which is an intersection pairing of cohomology classes.7 In fact,
we want to ‘lift’ the integral to the embedding space where the integration is trivial. Using
Poincaré duality and de Rham’s theorems relating homology and cohomology one can prove
the following theorem about complex integration over submanifolds: [16, 9]
7
Let M be a n-dimensional manifold. Using the operators defined in section 2, one can show that a k-form
ω on M is harmonic if and only if ∗ω is also harmonic. Since the space of harmonic k-forms is isomorphic to
k
the de Rham cohomology group HdR
(M, R), and that ∗ω is a (n − k)-form, there is an isomorphism between
n−k

(M, R) ∼

Theorem 3.2. Let X be a closed k-dimensional submanifold of M, where
R M is n-dimensional.

For any closed form τ ∈ HdR (M, R), we can define the integration X τ . By Stoke’s theorem, this

We call ηX the Poincaré dual class to X.

Therefore, the Poincaré dual class restricts the integration to the submanifold X like a
delta function. But how do we find ηX ? In fact in the special case where the normal bundle
NX to X is the restriction to X of some bundle over M, i.e. NX = E|X — which is the case
we consider, with E = OCP4 (5) — then it is easy to find ηX ; ηX = ck (E), where k is the rank
of E; that it is it is the top Chern class of E.
R
Thus, for the quintic we have that ηQ = c1 (OCP4 (5)) = 5x. Now, since CPm xm = 1 (this
is so because x is Poincaré dual to a hyperplane and m hyperplanes intersect at a point), we
find that

Now to pursue the study of the quintic further we must determine its Hodge numbers. Let
us first consider h2,1 , which classifies infinitesimal deformations of the complex structure. In
other words, given a polynomial equation of a certain degree in CPm , the complex structure
is determined by the free coefficients (usually called parameters) in the polynomial equation.
Fixing these parameters ‘chooses’ a particular complex structure; but by modifying these
coefficients we move in the moduli space of complex structures of the polynomial equation
of a certain degree. Therefore, these parameters classify infinitesimal deformations of the
complex structure, and h2,1 of the complete intersection manifold is equal to the number of
free parameters.
Remark 3.3. Note that this simple method for finding the Hodge numbers of a Calabi–Yau
manifold does not always work; the manifold must satisfy a few extra conditions. However
it works in this example and in the next example we will consider. Another method is to use
the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to compute h1,1 directly — see [17] for an explanation of
this technique.
For the quintic in CP4 , there are initially 126 parameters.8 The group of holomorphic
automorphisms of CPm being P GL(m+1, C),9 25−1 of them can be removed by an homogeneous linear change of variables. Moreover, one parameter corresponds to overall rescaling.

The projective linear group P GL(m + 1, C) is the general linear group GL(m + 1, C) quotiented by the
group Z(m + 1) of all nonzero scalar transformations, that is P GL(m + 1, C) = GL(m + 1, C)/Z(m + 1).

3.3 Examples

35

Hence, there are h2,1 (Q) = 126 − (25 − 1) − 1 = 101 parameters describing the complex
structure of Q.
Since χ = 2(h1,1 − h2,1 ), we have that h1,1 (Q) = 1, i.e. there is only one Ricci-flat Kähler
form on the quintic. Hence the Kähler structure moduli space is one-dimensional.
To summarize our result; the quintic Q in CP4 has Euler class χ = −200 and Hodge

Now we know that Q is a Calabi–Yau manifold, and we studied it using Chern classes. We
will now construct a holomorphic volume form Ω on Q. Alternatively, we could have started
our study of the quintic by attempting a direct construction of an holomorphic volume form,
and show that way that Q is indeed Calabi–Yau.
P
Define the form τ on C5 by τ = 4µ=0 dz0 ∧ . . . ∧ zµ ∧ . . . ∧ dz4 (notice that we have
replaced dzµ by zµ ). τ is clearly a holomorphic (4, 0)-form. However, it is not invariant
under scaling zµ → λzµ , so it is not well-defined on CP4 . But the form τ /Q is invariant,
where Q is a degree 5 homogeneous polynomial in CP4 . However, it is singular at Q = 0.

We have found an holomorphic volume form Ω on Q; therefore as we saw in the previous
section all other holomorphic (3, 0)-forms are constant multiples of Ω.
We can easily extend this construction to complete intersection manifolds constructed as
the zero-locus of a finite number of polynomials in a projective space.
This is the group of holomorphic automorphisms of CPm since the action of GL(m + 1, C) on Cm+1 descends
to an action of P GL(m + 1, C) on CPm .

3.3.4

The Tian-Yau manifold

In order to study the Tian-Yau manifold, we must generalize the results of the last section to
manifolds defined by the zero-locus of a finite number of homogeneous polynomial equations
in a product of projective spaces. Let us first introduce some notation.
Such spaces will be denoted by a configuration matrix which gives the degree of each
polynomial in the variables of each projective space. Each column corresponds to the degree
of one of the polynomial. We also usually add the Euler characteristic of the manifold at the
bottom right of the configuration matrix. For instance, in this notation the quintic in CP4
is given by
CP4 |5|−200 ,
(3.23)
while the Tian-Yau manifold is given by
CP3 1 3 0
.
CP3 1 0 3 −18
In other words, the Tian-Yau manifold is given by three polynomial equations in CP3 × CP3 ;
one of degree 1 in both CP3 , one of degree 3 in the first CP3 , and one of degree 3 in the

3.3 Examples

37

second CP3 . That is, if xµ and ym are respectively homogeneous coordinates of the two CP3 ,
it represents the system of equations
f µνρ xµ xν xρ = 0,

g mnr ym yn yr = 0,

hµm xµ ym = 0,

(3.24)

where f, g, h are coefficients of the equations.
Remark 3.4. In fact, the configuration matrix does not specify a particular manifold, but
rather the family of all complete intersections parameterized by the space of coefficients;
we call this family a configuration. As we noted earlier, two different sets of coefficients
correspond to two complete intersections which in general are different as complex manifolds.
The space of these coefficients is a parameter space for the complete intersection manifolds,
and by taking into account automorphisms of the ambient space and overall rescaling it
parameterizes the complex structure moduli space of this family of complete intersections.
Therefore, we should say that the Tian-Yau manifold is an element of the configuration
above, rather than the configuration itself. In fact, it is given by the following equations
with fixed coefficients:

xi yi = 0,

Now we want to compute the Euler characteristic and the Hodge numbers of this configuration. It is straightforward to generalize the results of the previous section.

in the l projective spaces. Given such a configuration, we can generalize the previous computation of the Chern class to obtain

For the Tian-Yau manifold, l = 2, n1 = n2 = 3, N = 3 and d11 = d21 = 1, d12 = 3, d22 = 0
and d13 = 0, d23 = 3. The condition is satisfied, and therefore the Tian-Yau manifold is a
Calabi–Yau manifold.
To find its Euler characteristic, we must expand the total Chern class to find an expression
for the third Chern class. If c1 (X) = 0, we find that

Using this general formula one can compute easily that the Euler characteristic of the TianYau manifold is χ = −18. Furthermore, one can show that the Euler characteristic of any
complete intersection Calabi–Yau manifold must be nonpositive, that is χ ≤ 0.
Now let us try to find the Hodge numbers of the Tian-Yau manifold. We will use the same
method as for the quintic, namely simply counting the free parameters in the polynomial
equations.

3.3 Examples

39

Two equations are of degree 3 in 4 variables, so together they have 40 free parameters.
However, in each CP3 (16 − 1) of them can be removed by a homogeneous linear change of
variables, and 1 by overall rescaling. Therefore in these two equations there are in total 8
free parameters.
Now the third equation has 16 coefficients, and 1 can be removed by oversall rescaling.
Therefore, in total there are 15 + 8 = 23 free parameters. Hence h2,1 (X) = 23. Further, from the equation χ = 2(h1,1 − h2,1 ), we find that the Tian-Yau manifold has Euler
characteristic χ = −18 and Hodge diamond

The Tian-Yau manifold was important historically as it was the first manifold to yield
a three-generation spectrum for the low-energy physics coming out of string theory. The
first attempts at finding the standard model from string theory used what is now called the

3.4 ‘Local’ Calabi–Yau manifolds

40

‘standard’ compactification of the E8 ×E8 heterotic string theory. In these compactifications,
the number of generations of the low-energy theory is given by half the absolute value of
the Euler characteristic of the compact Calabi–Yau threefold. Therefore, to find a threegeneration model we must have χ = ±6.
The Tian-Yau manifold does not satisfy this condition; however, it admits a free Z3
action which leads to a new (non-simply connected) Calabi–Yau threefold, X/Z3 , which has
Euler characteristic χ = −18/3 = −6. Therefore, compactification of heterotic strings on
the quotient threefold yields a three-generation model.
It may seem easy to construct three-generation manifolds, since there is a large number
of complete intersection Calabi–Yau threefolds in products of projective spaces (at least a
few thousands). But in fact, only a few phenomelogically interesting constructions have been
found that way, and they all seem to be simply related (see [17]). This is rather surprising, especially because Tian and Yau constructed their manifold before a list of complete
intersection Calabi–Yau threefolds was even compiled.
However, at the moment there are many other ways to construct Calabi–Yau manifolds,
although the technique we have explained is still probably the simplest one. For instance, one
can construct Calabi–Yau manifolds as hypersurfaces or complete intersections in weighted
projective spaces, as blow-up of orbifolds, as double fibrations, as hypersurfaces or complete
intersections in toric manifolds, etc. These constructions yield many other three-generation
manifolds.
Moreover, the standard compactification of heterotic strings was the first attempt at
extracting real physics from string theory, but there are now many other ways to obtain
phenomenologically interesting physics from string theory. For example, one can work in
type II theory, or consider ‘non-standard’ compactifications of heterotic strings, that is more
complicated compactifications where a vector bundle which is not the tangent bundle is embedded in the visible E8 gauge group of the E8 × E8 heterotic string. The last approach has
been pursued in recent years by various people (including me; this is the place where I plug
some of my work rather shamelessly :-), and has led, among other things, to an interesting
compactification of the E8 × E8 heterotic string [5, 6] which reproduces precisely the massless spectrum of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. It would be fascinating to
understand whether all these semi-realistic compactifications of string theory are somewhat
related, and why should string theory have chosen one of these vacua rather than all the
other non–realistic vacua floating around...

3.4

‘Local’ Calabi–Yau manifolds

To end this section, we give a quick definition of ‘local’ Calabi–Yau manifolds. So far, we
only considered compact manifolds, and our definitions of Calabi–Yau manifolds assumed
that the manifolds were compact. However, it is possible to generalize this definition to

41

admit noncompact Calabi–Yau manifolds. By local (or noncompact) Calabi–Yau manifolds,
we mean that they are open neighborhoods in compact Calabi–Yau manifolds. These are
very useful in many applications in physics, for instance in topological strings [19, 21]. They
are also relevant in the study of geometric transitions [22].
Some of the relations between the various definitions of Calabi–Yau manifolds introduced
earlier become somehow tricky for noncompact Calabi–Yau manifolds; rather than exploring
these details, we will simply adopt the following definition of local Calabi–Yau manifolds.
Definition 3.5. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a Kähler manifold (M, J, g) with trivial canonical
bundle.
This definition applies for both compact and noncompact manifolds. The simplest noncompact Calabi–Yau manifold is obviously Cm .

Toric geometry

So far we explored various aspects of complex geometry using tools of differential geometry,
sometimes bifurcating in the realm of algebraic geometry. We will now focus on a subset of
complex geometry, which is called toric geometry.
Toric varieties10 are a special kind of varieties which provide an elementary way to understand many abstract concepts of algebraic geometry. Owing to its beauty and simplicity,
toric geometry also gives the possibility to compute various non-trivial results in string theory
that could not be calculated otherwise.
In this section we explore various aspects of toric geometry relevant for applications in
physics, mainly in string theory. Our main goal will be to construct Calabi–Yau manifolds
in toric geometry. Therefore we will skip some important concepts and applications of
toric geometry. For good and more complete introductions to toric geometry, the reader
is referred to [16, 23, 13, 12]. This section, although based on the concepts of complex
geometry developed in the first three lectures, is almost independent from the rest of these
lecture notes.

4.1

Homogeneous coordinates

Toric varieties may be approached from various points of view. They can be described using
fans and homogeneous coordinates, or viewed as symplectic manifolds, or correspondingly
10

Roughly speaking, a variety is the algebraic analog of a manifold in differential geometry. More precisely,
an algebraic variety V ⊂ CPm is the zero locus in CPm of a collection of homogeneous polynomials. In fact,
any analytic subvariety of CPm is an algebraic variety; this is a restatement of Chow’s theorem mentioned
in section 1.1. For more information about analytic and algebraic varieties see [15]. In what follows we will
use the terms varieties and manifolds interchangeably.

4.1 Homogeneous coordinates

42

as the Higgs branch of the space of supersymmetric ground states of the gauged linear sigma
model, or even associated to convex polytopes in integral lattices. Perhaps the simplest
approach is the homogeneous coordinate description [11]; therefore we will proceed as far as
possible using this approach.
An interesting aspect of Cox’s approach to toric geometry is that by using the homogeneous coordinate construction, toric varieties look very much like the usual complex
(weighted) projective spaces. In fact, from that point of view we can understand toric
varieties as an algebraic generalization of (weighted) complex projective spaces.
Recall first the definition of the projective space CP2 . In section 1, we described CP2 by
embedding it into C3 :
CP2 = (C3 \ {0})/(C∗),
(4.1)
where the quotient is implemented by modding out by the equivalence relation
(x, y, z) ∼ λ(x, y, z),

(4.2)

where λ ∈ C∗ .
Then, we generalized this definition of projective spaces by assigning weights to the coordinates of Cm . For instance, we defined the weighted projective space CP(2,3,1) by embedding
it again into C3 :
CP2 = (C3 \ {0})/(C∗),
(4.3)
where the C∗ quotient is now implemented by modding out by the equivalence relation
(x, y, z) ∼ (λ2 x, λ3 y, λz),

(4.4)

where λ ∈ C∗ .
Now, toric varieties may be understood as a further generalization of weighted projective
spaces, where we quotient by more than one C∗ actions. That is, consider Cm and an action
by an algebraic torus (C∗ )p , p < m. We identify and then substract a subset U that is fixed
by a continuous subgroup of (C∗ )p , then safely quotient by this action to form
M = (Cm \ U) /(C∗ )p .

(4.5)

M is called a toric variety, as it still has an algebraic torus action by the group (C∗ )m−p
descending from the natural action of (C∗ )m on Cm .
For instance, both CP2 and CP(2,3,1) are toric varieties, as are all projective spaces and
weigthed projective spaces. But there are many more toric varieties then that.

4.1 Homogeneous coordinates

4.1.1

43

Cones and fans

We now explain how the toric varieties introduced above can be described combinatorially
using lattices. More precisely, we describe how to extract toric varieties from a fan using the
homogeneous coordinate approach developed by Cox [11].
Let M and N be a dual pair of lattices, viewed as subsets of vector spaces MR = M ⊗Z R
and NR = N ⊗Z R. Let (u, v) → hu, vi denote the pairings M × N → Z and MR × NR → R.
Definition 4.1. A strongly convex rational polyhedral cone σ ∈ NR is a set
s = {a1 v1 + a2 v2 + . . . + ak vk |ai ≥ 0}

(4.6)

generated by a finite number of vectors v1 , . . . , vk in N such that σ ∩ (−σ) = {0}.
Let us put words on this definition. Suppose that the lattice N is n-dimensional, that is
N ∼
= Zn . A convex rational polyhedral cone is an n or lower dimensional cone in NR , with
the origin of the lattice as its apex, such that it is bounded by finitely many hyperplanes
(‘polyhedra’), its edges are spanned by lattice vectors (‘rational’) and it contains no complete
line (‘strongly convex’).
A face of a cone σ is either σ itself or the intersection of σ with one of the hyperplanes
bounding σ.
Remark 4.2. In the remaining of this section we will refer to convex rational polyhedral cones
simply as cones.
Definition 4.3. A collection Σ of cones in NR is called a fan if each face of a cone in Σ is
also a cone in Σ, and the intersection of two cones in Σ is a face of each.
An example of a fan is given in figure 6.
Now let Σ be a fan in N. Let Σ(1) be the set of one-dimensional cones (or edges) of
Σ. From now on we will focus on three-dimensional toric varieties, or correspondingly on
three-dimensional lattices M, N ≃ Z3 .
Let vi , i = 1, . . . , k be the vectors generating the one-dimensional cones in Σ(1), where
k = |Σ(1)|. To each vi we associate an homogeneous coordinate wi ∈ C. From the resulting
Ck we remove the set
[
ZΣ = {(w1 , . . . , wk ) : wi = 0 ∀ i ∈ I},
(4.7)
I

where the union is taken over all sets I ⊆ {1, . . . , k} for which {wi : i ∈ I} does not belong
to a cone in Σ. In other words, several wi are allowed to vanish simultaneously only if there
is a cone such that the corresponding vi all belong to this cone.

4.1 Homogeneous coordinates

Then the toric variety is given by
MΣ =

Ck \ Z(Σ)
G

(4.8)

where G is (C∗ )k−3 times a finite abelian group. For all the toric varieties we consider in
these lectures the finite abelian group is trivial, so from now on we will omit it (see [23] for
an explanation of this group). The quotient by (C∗ )k−3 is implemented by taking equivalence
classes with respect to the following equivalence relations among the coordinates wi

the Qia such that they are integer and the greatest common divisor of the Qia with fixed a is
1.
Using this construction, it is easy to see that the complex dimension of a toric variety is
always equal to the real dimension n of the lattice N ∼
= Zn .

Example 4.4. Let us come back to the example of CP2 (which is two-dimensional rather
than three-dimensional, but easier to visualize as a first example). The fan is given by
the first picture in figure 6. There are three one-dimensional cones generated by the vectors
v1 = (1, 0), v2 = (0, 1) and v3 = (−1, −1), to which we associate the homogeneous coordinates
w1 , w2 and w3 of C3 . The set ZΣ is simply {0}, and thus the toric variety is given by
MΣ = (C3 \ {0})/(C∗).

Moreover, we have that 1(1, 0) + 1(0, 1) + 1(−1, −1) = (0, 0), so the C∗ quotient is implemented by the equivalence relation (w1 , w2 , w3 ) ∼ λ(w1 , w2 , w3 ). This is the usual description
of CP2 .
Example 4.5. Now consider again CP(2,3,1) . The fan is given by the second picture in figure
6. Again, ZΣ = {0}, and
MΣ = (C3 \ {0})/(C∗).
(4.11)
But now, we have that 2(1, 0)+3(0, 1)+1(−2, −3) = (0, 0), so the C∗ quotient is implemented
by the equivalence relation (w1 , w2 , w3 ) ∼ (λ2 w1 , λ3 w2 , λw3 ).
4.1.2

Properties

We now state a few important properties of toric varieties, without proof. First, it is straightforward to know whether a toric variety is compact or not:
Proposition 4.6. A toric variety MΣ is compact if and only if its fan Σ fills NR .
The reader is referred to [12] for a proof of this proposition, which will be very useful
later on. For example, the fans of both CP2 and CP(2,3,1) , shown in figure 6, fill NR ; hence
both manifolds are indeed compact.
It is also easy to see whether a toric variety is singular or not. We first need to define a
few additional concepts. An r-dimensional cone is simplicial if it is generated by r linearly
independent one-dimensional vectors. We say that a fan is simplicial if all its cones are
simplicial. Then, given a simplifical fan Σ it can be shown that the associated toric variety
MΣ can only have orbifold singularities. Moreover, if every n-dimensional cone of Σ is
generated by vectors that generate the whole lattice N, then MΣ is smooth.
Hence, toric geometry provides a simple way to resolve orbifold singularities. Given a
fan corresponding to a singular manifold, one can resolve the orbifold singularities by adding
cones to the fan until every n-dimensional cone is generated by vectors generating N. This
is one of the many aspects of toric geometry which is often used in string theory. However,
we will not expand more on this in these notes; we simply give a quick example of how this
works.
Example 4.7. Let us come back again to CP2 and CP(2,3,1) . First, in the case of CP2 ,
each two-dimensional cone in the fan is generated by vectors that generate N; hence CP2 is
smooth, as expected.
However the story is different for CP(2,3,1) . The fan is given by the first picture of figure 7.
It is easy to see that the fan is simplicial (this is always the case for two-dimensional lattices),
but that two of the three two-dimensional cones are not generated by vectors generating N.
Hence CP(2,3,1) has orbifold singularities. In fact, one can check that it has two singularities,

looking locally like C2 /Z2 and C2 /Z3 [23]. To blow up these singularities, we add cones to
the fan until all two-dimensional cones are generated by vectors generating N; we obtain
the second picture of figure 7, to which the associated manifold MΣ is smooth. The 3 extra
toric divisors — see the next subsection for a definition of toric divisors — v4 , v5 and v6 that
we added correspond to the blown up exceptional divisors.
4.1.3

Toric divisors

In a toric variety there is a natural set of divisors called toric divisors.
Definition 4.8. Let MΣ be a toric variety described by a fan Σ. As usual, associate an
homogeneous coordinates wi to each vector vi generating the one-dimensional cones of Σ.
The toric divisors Di of MΣ are the hypersurfaces defined by the equations wi = 0.
Since we associated an homogeneous coordinates wi to each one-dimensional cones vi in
the fan Σ of MΣ , we can think of the vectors vi as corresponding to the toric divisors defined
by wi = 0.
Similarly, higher-dimensional cones of Σ correspond to lower dimensional algebraic subvarieties of MΣ .
In fact, it can be shown (see [12]), by using methods very similar to those used for complex
projective spaces, that the canonical bundle of MΣ is given by
X
KMΣ = O(−
Di ).

This result will be useful to determine whether a toric variety is Calabi–Yau or not.

4.2 Toric Calabi–Yau threefolds

Toric Calabi–Yau threefolds

We will now implement the Calabi–Yau condition on toric threefolds.
P
We have seen in the first section that to a divisor D = i ai Ni we can associate a line
bundle with a meromorphic section such that the meromorphic section has a zero of order
ai along Ni if ai > 0 and a pole of order −ai along Ni if ai < 0. The Ni are irreducible
hypersurfaces, that is hypersurfaces that cannot be written as the union of two hypersurfaces.
In the toric case, the toric divisors Di defined by wi = 0 are irreducible hypersurfaces.
Therefore, using the above correspondence we see that the toric divisor Di is associated to
a line bundle O(Di ) with a section s that has a zero of order one along Di ; thus the section
s is simply wi . Hence we see that each homogeneous coordinate wi is a section of the line
bundle O(Di ) associated to the toric divisor Di .
Now, if we consider a monomial w1a1 · · · wkak ; for ai > 0, it has zeroes of order ai along
Di , while for aj < 0, it has poles of order −aj along Dj . Therefore it is a section of the line
P
bundle O( i ai Di ).
Let us now consider the case where ai = hvi , mi, i = 1, . . . , k for some m ∈ M. Under
the equivalence relations of the toric variety the monomial becomes

But since i=1 Qia vi = 0, this monomial is invariant under the equivalence relations and
therefore it is a true, globally defined, meromorphic function on our toric variety. This
means that it must be a section of the trivial line bundle, that is
k
X

hvi , miDi ∼ 0 for any m ∈ M.

(4.14)

i=1

Conversely, if

Pk

i=1 ai Di ∼ 0, then there exists a m ∈ M such that ai = hvi , mi for all i.

Now, we know that a Kähler manifold is Calabi–Yau if and only if its canonical class is
trivial. We saw in the previous
Pk section that the canonical line bundle of a toric variety MΣ
∼
is given by KMΣ = O(− i=1 Di ). Therefore the canonical bundle is trivial if and only if
Pk
i=1 Di ∼ 0. Using (4.14), we see that this condition is equivalent to the existence of a
m ∈ M such that hvi , mi = 1 for all i, which leads to the following proposition.

Proposition 4.9. Let MΣ be a toric manifold defined by a fan Σ. MΣ is Calabi–Yau if
and only if the vectors vi generating the one-dimensional cones of MΣ all lie in the same
affine hyperplane.
It is thus very easy to see whether a toric variety is Calabi–Yau or not; in fact, it can
be read off directly from the fan Σ of the toric variety. For instance, according to this
proposition it is clear that CP2 and CP(2,3,1) are not Calabi–Yau, as expected.
A consequence of proposition 4.9 is the following:

4.2 Toric Calabi–Yau threefolds

48

Corollary 4.10. A toric Calabi–Yau manifold is noncompact.
Since the vi lie in a hyperplane, Σ does not fill NR . Thus proposition 4.6 tells us that
MΣ is noncompact.
This seems like a serious limitation of toric geometry, since in string theory we are often
interested in compact Calabi–Yau manifolds. However, we will see in section 4.5 how to
construct compact Calabi–Yau manifolds in toric geometry.
The Calabi–Yau condition can be rewritten in yet another equivalent form. In (4.9) we
defined the ‘charges’ (the meaning of this name will become clear in section 4.3) Qia satisfying
Pk
Pk
i
i
M. In particular, there exists
i=1 Qa hvi , mi = 0 for any m ∈
i=1 Qa vi = 0. Therefore
Pk
an m ∈ M such that hvi , mi = 1 for all i if and only if i=1 Qia = 0 for all a. But we
showed that a toric manifold is Calabi–Yau if and only if there exists and m ∈ M such that
hvi , mi = 1 for all i. Therefore, the condition can be restated as follows:
Proposition 4.11. A toric manifold is Calabi–Yau if and only if the charges Qia satisfy the
P
condition ki=1 Qia = 0 for all a.

This condition is also very simple to verify. We only have to check that the charges Qia
given in the toric data describing the manifold add up to zero. Thus, if we are given a fan
we simply check that the vi lie in an affine hyperplane, while if we are given the toric data
we simply verify that the charges add up to zero.

To conclude this section we introduce a nice pictorial way of characterizing toric Calabi–
Yau threefolds. We showed that for toric Calabi–Yau threefolds the vi lie in a two-dimensional
plane P . Therefore, we can draw the two-dimensional graph Γ̃ given by the intersection of the
plane P and the fan Σ. Γ̃ determines completely the fan Σ of a toric Calabi–Yau threefold.
Given Γ̃, we can draw a ‘dual’ graph Γ in the sense that the edges of Γ̃ are normals to the
edges of Γ and vice-versa. Γ is called the toric diagram of a toric Calabi–Yau threefolds MΣ .
It represents the degeneration of the fibers of the torus fibration. We will describe in more
details toric diagrams in section 4.3.
Conversely, given a toric diagram Γ, it is straightforward to recover the fan Σ of the
toric Calabi–Yau threefold. One first draws the dual graph Γ̃, and then define the vectors
vi = (νi , 1) where νi are the vertices of Γ̃. Because of the symmetries of a three-dimensional
lattice, the vi must be the generators of the edges of the fan Σ of the toric Calabi–Yau
threefold MΣ . Linear relations between the vectors vi give the charges Qia . In other words,
the fan Σ is a three-dimensional cone over the two-dimensional graph Γ̃. An example of
graphs Γ and Γ̃ is given in figure 8.

4.3

Toric diagrams and symplectic quotients

In this section we describe the toric diagrams introduced above. To do so, we need to
leave momentarily the homogeneous coordinates approach to toric varieties and see toric
manifolds as symplectic quotients, or correspondingly as the Higgs branch of the space of
supersymmetric vacua of the gauged linear sigma model.
4.3.1

Toric manifolds as symplectic quotients

Let z1 , . . . , zk be the coordinates of Ck . Let µa : Ck → C, a = 1, . . . , k − 3 be the k − 3
moment maps defined by

(4.15)
i=1

where the ta are complex numbers. The Qia are the same charges that were introduced in
P
(4.9). Therefore, the Calabi–Yau condition imposes that ki=1 Qia = 0 for all a. We also
consider the action of the group G = U(1)k−3 on the coordinates defined by
zj → exp(iQja αa )zj ,
It turns out that

a = 1, . . . , k − 3.

4.3 Toric diagrams and symplectic quotients

50

Furthermore, since the charges Qia are the same asP
in (4.9), it is easy to recover the fan of
M. One only has to find distinct vectors vi satisfying ki=1 Qia vi = 0; the vi generate the oneP
dimensional cones of Σ. Moreover, since the Calabi–Yau condition tells us that ki=1 Qia = 0,
we can choose (because of the symmetries of three-dimensional lattices) vectors vi of the form
vi = (νi , 1). The problem is then reduced to a two-dimensional problem which can easily
be solved by inspection. We see that the charges Qia are the important data defining the
Calabi–Yau toric manifolds. This is usually called the toric data of the manifold.
This description of toric manifolds also arise in gauged linear sigma models. This is a
two-dimensional U(1)k−3 gauge theory with k chiral superfields Φi , whose scalar components
are the zk . The charges of the superfields Φi under the gauge group U(1)k−3 are denoted by
Qia , a = 1, . . . , k − 3. This is why the Qia are generally called charges. It turns out that — in
the Higgs branch — the supersymmetric ground states of the theory are parameterized by
the so-called D-term equations modulo gauge equivalence, which are nothing but the moment
maps µa defined in (4.15). In other words, the Higgs branch of the space of supersymmetric
ground states of the gauged linear sigma model is the toric variety M defined above.
Now equipped with the description of toric Calabi–Yau threefolds as symplectic quotients,
let us come back to the toric diagrams introduced in section 4.2. There, we claimed that
these diagrams encode the degenaration of the fibers of the manifold. This can be seen in
two different ways: by looking at the threefold as a T 3 fibration or as a T 2 × R fibration.
We will start with the first approach in section 4.3.2, which is probably simpler. We will
explore the second point of view in section 4.3.3, using the topological vertex approach to
toric Calabi–Yau threefolds.
4.3.2

T 3 fibration

We look at the threefolds as T 3 fibrations over three dimensional base manifolds with corners. Locally, we can introduce complex coordinates on the toric manifold: these are the
zi introduced in (4.15). They are not all independent; for a threefold, there are k − 3 relations between them given by the moment maps (4.15). Let us rewrite these coordinates as
zj = |zj |eiθj , and introduce a new set of coordinates {(p1 , θ1 ), . . . , (pk , θk )}, with pi ≡ |zi |2 ,
i = 1, . . . , k. The base of the threefold is then parameterized by the coordinates pi , while
the phases θi describe the fiber T 3 .
Since |zi |2 ≥ 0, the coordinates pi satisfy pi ≥ 0. Therefore the boundaries of the base
are where some of the coordinates pi vanish. But when pj = 0 the circle |zj |eiθj degenerates
to a single point. Hence, the boundaries of the base correspond to degenerations of the
corresponding fiber directions θj . Geometrically, this means that the fiber degenerates in
the direction given by the unit normal to the boundary.
To draw the toric diagram, we first use the moment maps (4.15) to express the coordinates
pj , j = 4, . . . , k in terms of the three coordinates p1 , p2 , p3 . Consequently, the boundary

4.3 Toric diagrams and symplectic quotients

51

equations pj = 0, j = 4, . . . , k become equations in the coordinates p1 , p2 and p3 involving
the Kähler parameters tj of (4.15). In fact, each boundary equation gives a plane in the
space generated by p1 , p2 and p3 . The intersections of these planes are lines; they form
the toric diagram of the toric variety, visualized as a three dimensional graph in the space
generated by p1 , p2 and p3 .
Hence, in this approach the toric diagram is simply the boundary of the three dimensional
base parameterized by the pi . There is a T 3 fiber over the generic point, which degenerates at
the boundaries in a way determined by the unit normal. Thus, from this point of view toric
diagrams should be visualized as three dimensional diagrams, encoding the degeneration of
the T 3 fiber. It is perhaps simpler to understand this approach by working out a specific
example.
Example 4.12. Let us find the toric diagram of O(−3) → CP2 from this point of view. This
manifold is defined by the moment map p1 + p2 + p3 − 3p4 = t, which we can use to express
p4 = 31 (p1 + p2 + p3 − t). The boundary planes are then given by p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0 and
p1 + p2 + p3 = t. The intersections of these planes give the toric diagram of O(−3) → CP2 ,
which is drawn in figure 9. We see that it is the same toric diagram as the one shown in
figure 8, but visualized as a three dimensional graph. Note that from the fourth boundary
equation one can see that the Kähler parameter t controls the size of the CP2 , as it should
be.

This is indeed an easy way to visualize the geometry of the manifold from the toric
diagram; another example of this approach will be given in section 4.4. However, it turns out
that in many situations it is more enlightening to consider the manifold as a T 2 ×R fibration,

4.3 Toric diagrams and symplectic quotients

52

especially from the topological vertex perspective. Let us now describe this alternative
viewpoint.
4.3.3

T 2 × R fibration

In this language, a toric diagram Γ is a two-dimensional graph which represents the degeneration locus of the T 2 × R fibration over the base R3 . Over a line in Γ in the direction (q, p),
the cycle (−q, p) of the T 2 fiber degenerates.
To exhibit this structure, we will now follow the topological vertex approach to toric
Calabi–Yau threefolds developed by Aganagic, Klemm, Mariño and Vafa in [1]. A good
review is [19].
The fundamental idea behind this approach is that toric Calabi–Yau threefolds are built
by gluing together C3 patches. Therefore, the first step is to describe C3 (which is the simplest
noncompact toric Calabi–Yau threefold) as a T 2 × R fibration and exhibit its degeneration
locus in a two-dimensional graph Γ, which turns out to be a trivalent vertex. Then, more
general geometries are constructed by gluing together C3 patches, which, in the toric diagram
language, corresponds to gluing together trivalent vertices in a way specified by the toric
data of the manifold.
Conversely, given a toric Calabi–Yau threefold, we can find a decomposition of the set
of all coordinates into triplets that correspond to the decomposition of the threefold into
C3 patches. The moment maps (4.15) relate the coordinates between the patches, therefore
describing how the trivalent vertices corresponding to the C3 patches are glued together to
form the toric diagram of the manifold.
Let us start by describing C3 from this point of view. Here we will only sketch the
description; the details are given in [19, 1]. Let zi , i = 1, 2, 3 be complex coordinates on C3 .
Define the functions
rα (z) = |z1 |2 − |z3 |2 ,
rβ (z) = |z2 |2 − |z3 |2 ,
rγ (z) = Im(z1 z2 z3 ).

(4.18)

It turns out that these functions generate the fiber T 2 × R. More specifically, R is generated
by rγ while the T 2 fiber is generated by the circle actions
exp(iαrα + iβrβ ) : (z1 , z2 , z3 ) → (eiα z1 , eiβ z2 , e−i(α+β) z3 ).

(4.19)

The cycles generated by rα and rβ are then respectively referred to as the (0, 1) and (1, 0)
cycles.
We now describe the degeration loci of the fibers. We see from (4.18) and (4.19) that the
(0, 1) cycle degenerates when rα = 0 = rγ and rβ ≥ 0, while the (1, 0) cycle degenerates when

4.3 Toric diagrams and symplectic quotients

53

rα ≥ 0 = rγ and rβ = 0. There is also a one-cycle parameterized by α + β that degenerates
when rα − rβ = 0 = rγ and rα ≤ 0.
The toric diagram is a planar graph that encodes the degeneration loci of the fibers.
We can set rγ = 0 and draw the graph in the plane rα − rβ . The graph consists in lines
prα +qrβ = c where c is a constant. Over this line the (−q, p) cycle of the T 2 fiber degenerates
(up to the equivalence (q, p) ∼ (−q, −p)). For C3 , the degeneration loci can be represented
as a toric diagram with lines defined by the equations rα = 0, rβ ≥ 0; rβ = 0, rα ≥ 0 and
rα − rβ = 0, rα ≤ 0. Over these lines respectively the cycles (0, 1); (−1, 0) ∼ (1, 0) and (1, 1)
degenerate. This gives the trivalent vertex associated to C3 , which is shown in figure 10.
(0, 1)

(1, 0)

(−1, −1)
Figure 10: Trivalent vertex associated to C3 , drawn in the rα -rβ plan. The vectors represent
the generating cycles over the lines.

For more general geometries, we first find a decomposition of the set of coordinates zi ,
i = 1, . . . , k into triplets of coordinates associated to the C3 patches. We choose a patch and
describe the functions rα and rβ as above. It turns out that we can use these coordinates as
global coordinates for the T 2 fiber in the R3 base. As usual, we refer to the cycles rα and
rβ respectively as the (0, 1) and (1, 0) cycles. Using the moment maps (4.15) defining the
toric Calabi–Yau threefold, we can find the action of the functions rα and rβ on the other
patches and therefore draw the toric diagram giving the degeneration loci of the T 2 fiber.
An explicit example of this approach will be worked out in section 4.4.
This decomposition of toric Calabi–Yau threefolds into C3 patches leads to a similar
decomposition of topological string amplitudes on toric Calabi–Yau threefolds into a basic building block associated to the trivalent vertex of the C3 patches, which is called the
topological vertex. By gluing together these topological vertices one can build topological
string amplitudes on any toric Calabi–Yau threefold. This beautiful property of topological
amplitudes is the essence of the topological vertex approach developed in [1]. We will not
expand further on this subject; the interested reader is encouraged to go through the details
of the construction in [1].

4.4 Examples

54

In the next section we illustrate these different approaches to toric Calabi–Yau threefolds
in specific examples.

4.4

Examples

We now describe two examples of toric Calabi–Yau threefolds. The first example is the
resolved conifold, namely O(−1) ⊕ O(−1) → CP1 . In this simple case, we illustrate in
details the different viewpoints explained in the previous sections. The second example is
a more complicated geometry. It is a noncompact Calabi–Yau threefold whose compact
locus consists of two compact divisors each isomorphic to a del Pezzo surface dP2 11 and a
rational (−1, −1) curve that intersects both divisors transversely. We will give the toric data
describing the manifold and draw the corresponding toric diagram.
4.4.1

O(−1) ⊕ O(−1) → CP1

The resolved conifold Y = O(−1) ⊕ O(−1) → CP1 is a noncompact Calabi–Yau threefold
which admits a toric description given by the following toric data:

(4.20)

The lines in this table give the charges Qia corresponding to the torus actions on the homoP
geneous coordinates zi . We see that i Qi = 1 + 1 − 1 − 1 = 0; therefore Y is Calabi–Yau.
Y is defined as the space obtained from
|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 − |z3 |2 − |z4 |2 = t

(4.21)

after quotienting by the U(1) action specified by the charges in (4.20).
P
We now find the fan Σ describing Y . We have the relation 4i=1 Qi vi = v1 + v2 −v3 −v4 =
0. We choose distinct vectors vi = (wi , 1) where wi is two-dimensional. A solution is
v1 = (1, 0, 1), v2 = (−1, 0, 1), v3 = (0, 1, 1) and v4 = (0, −1, 1). These four vectors generate
the four one-dimensional cones of Σ.
The two-dimensional graph Γ̃ is given by the intersection of the plane z = 1 and Σ. The
vertices are (1, 0),(−1, 0),(0, 1) and (0, −1). We can also draw the toric diagram, which is
the dual graph Γ. They are shown in figure 11.
If we look at the resolved conifold as a T 3 fibration, we have to understand the toric
diagram Γ as a three-dimensional graph representing the base, where the T 3 fiber degenerates

at the boundaries. The base is parameterized by the four coordinates pi ≡ |zi |2 subject to
the relation (4.21). We can use (4.21) to eliminate p4 ,
p4 = p1 + p2 − p3 − t.

(4.22)

Therefore, since |zi |2 ≥ 0, the boundary equations of the toric base are given by
p1 = 0,
p2 = 0,
p3 = 0,
p1 + p2 − p3 = t.

(4.23)

The intersections of these planes give the toric diagram of the resolved conifold shown
in figure 11, but visualized as a three dimensional graph as in figure 12. Note that as in
example 4.12, by the fourth boundary equation above one can see that the Kähler parameter
t controls the size of the CP1 , as it should be.
We can also describe the resolved conifold as a T 2 × R fibration, using its decomposition
into C3 patches. We choose the first patch to be defined by z1 6= 0. Using (4.21) we can
express z1 in terms of the other coordinates, so the patch is parameterized by (z2 , z3 , z4 ). We
define the functions
rα = |z3 |2 − |z2 |2 ,
rβ = |z4 |2 − |z2 |2 .
This gives the usual trivalent graph of C3 .

we can rewrite the functions (4.24) in terms of the coordinates on this patch:
rα = |z1 |2 − |z4 |2 + t,
rβ = |z1 |2 − |z3 |2 + t.

exp(iαrα + iβrβ ) : (z1 , z3 , z4 ) → (ei(α+β) z1 , e−iβ z3 , e−iα z4 ).

In this patch, the (0, 1) cycle degenerates when rα ≤ −t and rβ = −t. The (1, 0) cycle
degenerates when rα = −t and rβ ≤ −t. The (1, 1) cycle degenerates when rα − rβ = 0
and rα ≥ −t. Therefore, the graph associated to this patch is identical to the first one,
although it is shifted such that its origin is at the point (−t, −t). The two graphs are joined
through the common edge given by rα − rβ = 0. t gives the ‘length’ of the internal edge, and
correspondingly is the Kähler parameter associated to the CP1 . This gives the toric diagram
of the resolved conifold shown in figure 13.

surface dP2 and a rational (−1, −1) curve that intersects both divisors transversely. The

We see that the charges in each line add up to zero, hence X is Calabi–Yau. The toric

Hypersurfaces in toric varieties

In the remaining of this section we explain how compact Calabi–Yau manifolds may be obtained in toric geometry, namely as hypersurfaces in compact toric manifolds using Batyrev’s
well known reflexive polytopes [2].

4.5.1

Reflexive polytopes

In section 4.1 we described in details toric Calabi–Yau threefolds. In particular, we showed
that toric Calabi–Yau threefolds are noncompact. However, from a string theory perspective,
it is often desirable to consider compact Calabi–Yau manifolds. Hence it seems that toric
geometry is not a good setup for such geometries.
Fortunately, there is a way to construct compact Calabi–Yau manifolds in toric geometry,
namely as compact hypersurfaces in compact toric varieties. Batyrev’s reflexive polytopes [2]
provide a very useful description of such compact Calabi–Yau manifolds. The toric variety
itself is not Calabi–Yau consequently it can be compact. Reflexivity of the polytopes then
ensures that the compact hypersurface, which is not toric itself, is Calabi–Yau.
An elementary introduction to these concepts and their applications to string theory and
dualities can be found in [23]. The following is partly based on the first sections of [3].
As in section 4.1, in the following we focus on three-dimensional toric varieties, therefore leading to two-dimensional Calabi–Yau hypersufaces, i.e. K3 surfaces. It is however
straightforward to generalize the concepts to higher dimensional toric varieties.
A polytope in MR is the convex hull of a finite number of points in MR , and a polyhedron
in MR is the intersection of finitely many half-spaces (given by inequalities hu, vi ≥ c with
some v ∈ NR and c ∈ R) in MR . It is well known that any polytope is a polyhedron and any
bounded polyhedron is a polytope. If a polyhedron ∆ ⊂ MR contains the origin 0, its dual
∆∗ = {v ∈ NR : hu, vi ≥ −1 for all u ∈ ∆}.

(4.28)

4.5 Hypersurfaces in toric varieties

59

is also a polyhedron containing 0, and (∆∗ )∗ = ∆.
A lattice polytope in MR is a polytope with vertices in M.
Definition 4.13. A polytope ∆ ⊂ MR containing 0 is called reflexive if both ∆ and ∆∗ are
lattice polytopes.
This is equivalent to ∆ being a lattice polytope whose bounding equations are of the form
P
hu, vii ≥ −1 with vi ∈ N (in coordinates, j uj vij ≥ −1 with integer coefficients vij ). By
convexity it is sufficient to consider only those equations corresponding to vi that are vertices
of ∆∗ . In this way there is a duality between vertices of ∆∗ and facets of ∆; similarly, there
are dualities between p-dimensional faces of ∆ and (n − p − 1)-dimensional faces of ∆∗ (in
three dimensions: between edges and dual edges).
An interior point u of a reflexive polytope must satisfy hu, vii > −1 for all vi , so an
interior lattice point must satisfy hu, vii ≥ 0. Thus if u is an interior lattice point, then nu
is also an interior lattice point for any non-negative integer n. For u 6= 0 this would be in
conflict with the boundedness of ∆, implying that 0 is the only interior lattice point.
4.5.2

Toric interpretation

Given a pair of three dimensional reflexive polytopes ∆ ∈ MR , ∆∗ ∈ NR , a smooth K3
surface can be constructed in the following way. Any complete triangulation of the surface
of ∆∗ defines a fan Σ whose three dimensional cones are just the cones over the regular (i.e.,
lattice volume one) triangles. To any lattice point pi = (x̄i , ȳi , z̄i ) on the boundary of ∆∗
one can assign a homogeneous coordinate wi ∈ C, with the rule that several wi are allowed
to vanish simultaneously only if there is a cone such that the corresponding pi all belong to
this cone. The equivalence relations among the homogeneous coordinates are given by

(4.29)
P i
with any set of integers Qia such that
Qa pi = 0; among these relations, k − 3 are independent. This construction gives rise to a smooth compact three dimensional toric variety MΣ
(smooth because the generators of every cone are also generators of N, compact because the
fan fills NR ). The loci wi = 0 are the toric divisors Di .
Q hq ,p i+1
To any lattice point qj of M we can assign a monomial mj = i wi j i ; the exponents
are non-negative as a consequence of reflexivity. The hypersurface defined by the zero-locus
P
of a generic polynomial P =
aj mj transforms homogeneously under (4.29) and can be
shown to define a K3 hypersurface in MΣ (actually it defines a family of hypersurfaces
depending on the coefficients aj ).
Remark 4.14. A good way to remember this construction is to note that the polytope in
∆∗ ∈ NR gives the faN of the ambient toric variety, while the polytope in ∆ ∈ MR gives the
MonoMials.

Figure 15: The polytope representation of an elliptic curve as a hypersurface in CP2 .

Example 4.15. Let us give the example of a Calabi–Yau hypersurface in CP2 , which is an
elliptic curve. The complete triangulation of the polytope ∆∗ ∈ NR should give the fan of
CP2 presented in figure 6. As usual, we associate the homogeneous coordinates x, y, z to the
one-dimensional cones in the fan. This is shown in figure 15. It is now easy to compute
the dual polytope ∆ ∈ MR , to which we associate monomials as above. The family of
hypersurfaces that we obtain is then given by the zero locus of cubic polynomials in CP2 ,
which is a well known way of describing an elliptic curve.
4.5.3

Calabi–Yau condition

In fact, it was shown by Batyrev [2] that the hypersurface defined by the vanishing of a
generic polynomial in the class determined by ∆ is a smooth Calabi–Yau manifold for n ≤ 4,
where n is the dimension of the lattice M. For n ≤ 3 the underlying toric variety is smooth;
in particular for n = 3 the hypersurface describes a smooth K3 surface as explained above.
For n = 4 it may have point–like singularities, which are however missed by the generic
hypersurface describing the Calabi–Yau threefold.
Let us now explain why the hypersurface is a Calabi–Yau manifold. Let a manifold
X be defined by the equation P = 0 in a toric variety M. As we have seen in the first
section, the polynomial P defines a section of a line bundle (other sections are defined by
different coefficients aj ). The divisor class of the line bundle can be read off from any
monomial in
P always includes the
P
Q P . Since the origin is always included in the polytopes,
monomial ki=1 wi , which corresponds to the divisor class [ ki=1 Di ]. Thus, the polynomial
P determines a section of the anticanonical bundle of the toric variety M, which is crucial.

4.5 Hypersurfaces in toric varieties

We have seen in section 3 that in this case P serves as a coordinate near X, and in fact
∗
the normal bundle NX of X is simply KM
|X , since P is a section of the anticanonical bundle
1,0
of M. Thus, the exact sequence 0 → T X → T 1,0 M|X → NX → 0 becomes
∗
0 → T 1,0 X → T 1,0 M|X → KM
|X → 0.

(4.30)

Now, given any holomorphic vector bundle B over X of rank k and any holomorphic subbundle A, one can always form the respective determinant bundles det B and det A which
satisfy the identity det B = det A ⊗ det(B/A). Using the above exact sequence, we can then
write
∗
det T 1,0 M|X = det T 1,0 X ⊗ det KM
|X .
(4.31)
Using the definition of the anticanonical bundle as the determinant line bundle of the holo∗

morphic tangent bundle and the fact that det KM
= KM
since KM
is a line bundle, we
find

that is the canonical bundle KX of X is trivial, hence it is Calabi–Yau.
4.5.4

Fibration structure

An interesting fact about Calabi–Yau manifolds constructed as above is that their fibration
structure (if any) can be read off directly from the reflexive polytopes. Let us explain how
this works for an elliptically fibered K3 surface.
Take a three-dimensional pair of reflexive polytopes ∆ and ∆∗ describing a K3 manifold.
Suppose that the intersection of ∆∗ with the plane z̄ = 0 gives a reflexive polygon. We may
reinterpret P as a polynomial in the wi for which z̄i = 0, with coefficients depending on the
remaining wi , i.e. we are dealing with an elliptic curve parameterized by the wi for which
z̄i 6= 0. The map MΣ → P1 ,
Y
wiz̄i
(4.34)
(w1 , . . . , wn ) → W =
i:z̄i 6=0

is easily checked to be consistent with (4.29) and thus well defined. At any point of the P1
that is neither 0 nor ∞ all the wi with z̄i 6= 0 are non-vanishing, and (4.29) can be used to
set all except one of them to 1. Hence, this gives the K3 surface the structure of an elliptic
fibration.
It is easy to see that this kind of structure also holds for fibrations of higher-dimensional
Calabi–Yau varieties. Given a Calabi–Yau manifold X with a fibration structure such that
the fiber is a lower-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold, the fiber is described by a subpolytope
∆∗fiber of the reflexive polytope ∆∗ associated to X. See [23] for more on this subject.

Hodge numbers

Another interesting property of the Batyrev’s construction is that the Hodge numbers can
be read off directly from the lattice data describing the Calabi–Yau manifold. We will not
give the explicit formulae here; the reader is referred to [2]. Owing to this fact, Calabi–
Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties offer a fantastic playground to learn more about mirror
symmetry, which exchanges the Hodge numbers h2,1 and h1,1 of a Calabi–Yau threefold. In
fact, mirror symmetry for hypersurfaces of toric varieties has been studied extensively and
led to many interesting insights, as explained in [16].
