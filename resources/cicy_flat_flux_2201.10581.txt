Abstract: In this paper, we extend the analysis of scanning the perturbatively flat flux
vacua (PFFV) for the type IIB orientifold compactifications on the mirror of the projective
complete intersection Calabi-Yau (pCICY) 3-folds, which are realized as hypersurfaces in
the product of complex projective spaces. The main objective of this scan is to investigate
the behaviour of PFFV depending on the nature of CY 3-folds in the light of the observations made in [1] where it has been found that K3-fibered CY 3-folds have significantly large
number of physical vacua as compared to other geometries. For this purpose, we present the
PFFV statistics for all the 36 pCICYs with h1,1 = 2 and classify them into two categories
of being K3-fibered model and non K3-fibered model. We subsequently confirm that all the
K3-fibered models have a significantly large number of PFFV leading to physical vacua by
fixing the axio-dilaton by non-perturbative effects, while only a couple of non K3-fibered
models have such physical vacua. For h1,1 = 2 case, we have found that there are five
pCICY 3-folds with the suitable exchange symmetry leading to the so-called exponentially
flat flux vacua (EFFV) which are protected against non-perturbative prepotential effects
as well. By exploring the underlying exchange symmetries in the favorable CY 3-folds with
h1,1 ≥ 3 in the dataset of 7820 pCICYs, we have found that there are only 13 spaces which
can result in EFFV configurations, and therefore most of the CY 3-folds are a priory suitable for fixing the dilaton valley of the flat vacua using the non-perturbative prepotential
contributions.

Introduction

Since critical superstring theory is defined in 10 spacetime dimensions, one needs to compactify the theory on a 6-manifold in order to extract the relevant low energy effective field
theory in 4 dimensions. In this context, one of the main open problems regards the stabilization of moduli, scalar fields present in the effective theory, whose vacuum expectation
value (VEV) is related to shape and size of the compactification space.
In this paper, we focus on IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau (CY) orientifold X. In such setup, the moduli stabilization typically is performed in two steps.
Complex structure moduli and the axio-dilaton are stabilized by background fluxes at
higher energy [2, 3]. Due to the no-scale property of the prepotential [4], this leaves all
directions corresponding to Kähler moduli flat. Those Kähler moduli are then stabilized
at much lower energies by the introduction of subleading effects, such as higher stringloop corrections, or non-perturbative effects as the presence of Euclidean 3-branes, or the
worldvolume dynamic of a D7-brane wrapping a rigid divisor and undergoing gaugino condensation [5, 6]. Famous Kähler moduli stabilization approaches include KKLT [7], LVS
[6], racetrack [8], Kähler uplift [9], perturbative LVS [10–12] and others.
Let F3 (resp. H3 ) be the Ramond-Ramond (resp. Neveu-Schwarz) three-form flux, S be
the axio-dilaton, and Ω3 the nowhere vanishing holomorphic three-form which X admits by
definition, being Calabi-Yau. After complex structure moduli and axio-dilaton stabilization

by the so-called Gukov-Vafa-Witten (GVW) superpotential [2], one is left with a constant

The viability of the subsequent Kähler moduli stabilization approach depends, sometimes,
on the explicit value of W0 . In particular, in the KKLT context it is necessary, for control
reasons, to have a relatively small flux superpotential. On these lines, there have been some
significant amount of attraction on the magnitude of W0 for model builders [1, 13–20]. In
[15] an explicit algorithm to achieve small superpotentials was put forward. Schematically,
first one looks for a flux choice that will generate a scalar potential with valleys of perturbatively flat supersymmetric vacua, which are in turn lifted by instanton effects. In this
context, a systematic scan of such flat vacua leading to physical solutions for the CY with
h1,1 = 2 from the Kreuzer-Skarke database has been presented in [1].
Motivation and goals
Despite being part of the so-called hidden sector, the relics of the compactifying CY 3folds make them omnipresent in the four-dimensional effective supergravity theory, or any
phenomenological model built within that framework. In this context, there are two main
CY dataset, namely the Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) database [21] and the so-called projective
complete intersection CY (pCICY) database [22–26]. Calabi-Yau manifolds of the pCICY
type are realized as the zero-locus of a collection of line bundle sections in an ambient
space A given by a product of complex projective spaces. This database was famously
systematized in [23], improved in [26], and contains 7890 different explicit CYs. Out of
them, at least 6651 are shown to be topologically distinct [27]. Furthermore, any other
pCICYs which do not belong to the database can be shown to be topologically equivalent
to one present in the database, which is therefore complete. Together with the KreuzerSkarke (KS) database of hypersurfaces in toric Fano 4-folds [21], and the generalized CICY
constructions [28], the original pCICY database is up-to-date one of the three largest and
explicitly mapped CY constructions.
The broad motivation and particular goals for the current work can be listed along the
following lines:
• Despite their extensive use in constructing MSSM-like models, the CY 3-folds of
the pCICY dataset have been rarely utilized for moduli stabilization and any subsequent phenomenological purposes such as realizing de-Sitter vacua and inflationary
aspects.1 Therefore, it makes to us much sense to investigate which CYs in this class
can host (flat) flux vacua with a small flux superpotential which being the central
ingredients of the KKLT-like moduli stabilization scheme can indeed open a new window for phenomenological applications of pCICYs in this direction. After computing
1

There have been some initiatives along these directions, e.g. for Heterotic moduli stabilization, see
[29, 30], and for moduli stabilization in type IIB setups [27, 31–33]. In addition, a complete list of explicit
classification of CICY orientifolds with non-trivial (1, 1)-cohomology has been also presented in [34].

–2–

all the divisor topologies on the pCICYs along with investigation of non-perturbative
superpotential contributions in a companion work we have already initiated some
progress in the direction of Kähler moduli stabilization [33].
• Using the CY 3-folds from the KS database, it has been observed in [1] that K3fibered mirror CY 3-folds result in significantly large number of perturbatively flat
flux vacua (PFFV). Therefore, it is interesting to investigate this observation for the
CY 3-folds of the pCICY database in order to check whether the previous observation
is accidental or there is some kind of generality in it, leading to some more deep
reasons behind this observation. This observation gets more crucial in the light of the
fact that the percentage of K3-fibered CY 3-folds increases very significantly with
increasing h1,1 not only for the KS database but also for the pCICY database, and
therefore it implies that there can be much more CY 3-folds which could possibly be
suitable for KKLT-like moduli stabilization.
In this regard, the central aim of this paper is to extensively run the algorithm of [15]
by taking compactification manifold X as the mirror Calabi-Yaus of those belonging
to the projective complete intersection CYs (pCICYs) dataset.
• However, we consider only a subset of CY 3-folds with h1,1 = 2 from the full pCICY
dataset for the purpose of studying this limited aspect. This approach is not only
pragmatic for making the overall task simpler but also sufficient to see the pattern
that K3-fibered pCICYs are singled out (with a large number of PFFVs) from the
full list of pCICYs with h1,1 = 2.
To be specific, we mainly focus on the 36 favorable pCICYs with h1,1 = 2 in our
current analysis. We find that only 18 of those give a total of 562 physical vacua via
fixing the flat valley through non-perturbative effects, with the lowest value of |W0 |
turns out to be |W0 | ∼ 10−27 . Among these 18 pCICYs, 16 of them are K3-fibered
and 2 of them are not.
In our detailed analysis using CY 3-folds from the pCICY dataset, we have indeed
confirmed that the number of PFFV is dominated by the K3-fibered pCICYs. Since
many pCICYs are K3-fibered [26], one expects to have a significant landscape of the
PFFV from the pCICY dataset which has a total of 7820 favorable CY 3-folds.
• After performing a detailed scan of PFFV for all the 36 PCICYs with h1,1 = 2, we
explore the possibilities of the so-called exponentially flat flux vacua (EFFV). Such
vacua remain flat also considering non-perturbative effects. In [1] we have observed
that such EFFV arise in the presence of an underlying symmetry in the CY 3-fold
which can be correlated with the so-called non-trivially identical divisors (NIDs)
necessary to have an exchange symmetry [35]. Because of the fact that the possibilities
of finding NIDs is quite large in pCICYs it raises a concern of most of the CY 3-folds
to result in EFFVs and hence unable to fix the dilaton valley by non-perturbative
prepotential effects at all. If it is really the case, then it certainly reduces the suitable
CY spaces for the purpose of realizing low |W0 | or KKLT-like mechanism to work. For

–3–

this reason, it is important to investigate the status of finding EFFVs by considering
CY 3-folds with h1,1 ≥ 3.
In this regard, we use the information about the divisor topologies of the pCICYs
which has been recently reported in [33]. This enables us to explore the CYs with
NIDs which could lead to EFFV configurations, beyond h1,1 = 2 as well. We find five
pCICYs with h1,1 = 2 that have this property, for a total of 9543 EFFV configurations
for the five CYs, out of a total number of 64520 PFFV configurations arising from
all the 36 pCICYs. Subsequently, we also discuss EFFV configurations for pCICY
geometries with larger h1,1 , by investigating the underlying exchange symmetry. In
particular, we find that only those pCICYs that have a single topology for all their
coordinate divisors (as classified in [33]), can leave the axio-dilaton valley still flat.
They are the most obvious pCICYs that may admit EFFV configurations. However,
we noticed that this is not a sufficient condition, since for some of them, the symmetry
is not respected at the level of intersection polynomial or the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV)
invariants [36, 37] entering the (instanton) prepotential. After invoking a genuine
symmetry considering all such exchange possibilities, we find only 13 pCICYs in
total that can lead to a non-perturbative superpotential which gets identically trivial
for such EFFV configurations. This investigation subsequently confirms that there
are not too many CY 3-folds in which can result in EFFVs and hence physical vacua
fixing the dilaton valley should be feasible in most of the pCICY 3-folds.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the necessary steps to find
perturbatively flat flux vacua (PFFV) as in [1, 15]. We also start the systematic analysis
of such PFFV in the pCICY manifolds with h1,1 = 2 in Section 3. In particular, in Section
3.1 we discuss the PFFV for those mirror pCICYs that are K3-fibered, finding all possible
physical vacua, and a similar analysis is done in Section 3.2 for the mirror pCICYs that
are not K3-fibered. In Section 4 we focus on the EFFV. We conclude in Section 5. In
Appendix A we review the geometry of the pCICYs, and we collect all the data necessary
to reproduce the computations.

Analyzing the perturbatively flat flux vacua

In this section, first we briefly summarize the steps leading to perturbatively flat flux vacua
introduced in [15], which have been rephrased/recollected in [1] subject to removing the flux
scaling redundancies. Subsequently, we will use these steps to systematically characterize
the perturbatively flat flux vacua for the mirror pCICY 3-folds, which have recently received
some significant amount of phenomenological interests [27, 33].
2.1

Recipe for low |W0 |

The overall recipe can be clubbed into the following four steps:
S1. Finding the flat vacua: First, we look for a flux vector M i constructed using the
three-form fluxes {F i , Hi } for which the following conditions hold:

–4–

S1a. There exists a matrix Nij = κ0ijk F k such that M i = N ij Hj , which is orthogonal
to the NS-NS flux vector, Hi , i.e. M i Nij M j = 0. Here the classical triple intersection numbers κ0ijk are defined through integration using the two-form basis
{Ji } as below,
Z
κ0ijk =

Ji ∧ Jj ∧ Jk ,

(2.1)

X̃3

S1b. The flux vector M i must lie within the Kähler cone of the mirror CY. This
means that in the 2-form basis of the Kähler cone generators, then we demand
M i > 0 for all the simplicial cases.
S1c. The flux vectors F i and Hi must satisfy the tadpole constrains, i.e. 0 ≤ −F i Hi ≤
2Q, for a total D3-brane charge Q.
S1d. All the so-called shifted fluxes [38, 39] Fi = p̃ij F j and F0 = p̃i F i must be
quantized to take integral values, where for a given CY 3-fold X̃3 [40, 41],

S2. Flux scaling redundancies: In order to avoid several equivalent flux vacua related
to each other by a simple scaling of the F i and Hi fluxes, we demand [1]
GCD ({Hi }) = 1 ,


GCD {F i , Hi } = 1 .

(2.3)

S3. Isolating PFFV with M 1 = M 2 : Applying Step S2, we encounter PFFV configurations with M 1 = M 2 . It has been found in [1] that such flux choices do not lead to
trustworthy physical vacua after instanton corrections are taken into account through
the prepotential. For these reasons, we demand the PFFV to satisfy Step S2 as well
as M 1 6= M 2 .
However, depending on the presence of a symmetry in the CY geometry it might be
possible that the non-perturbative effects are trivially decoupled in the EOM, leading to what we call as “exponentially flat flux vacua”. We will isolate such PFFV
configuration for performing a separate analysis.
S4. Fixing the flat valley: The Kähler potential of the complex structure moduli (U i )
sector solely depends on the axio-dilaton (S) along the perturbatively flat valley
U i = S M i , and the “effective” tree level axio-dilaton dependent term is given as [1],

where we have neglected the perturbative pieces involving the Euler characteristic
of the mirror CY because that piece effectively appears with an extra factor of gs−3
and in the weak coupling regime, it is not likely to compete with the leading order
effects. We define the axio-dilaton as S = c0 + ie−φ where c0 is the universal axion
and the string coupling gs is subsequently defined through the VEV of the dilaton

as gs = heφ i. Now, for stabilizing the perturbatively flat valley U i = S M i , we utilize
the non-perturbative effects in the superpotential which takes the following form [1],

where qi = e2πi U for i ∈ {1, 2} and we have considered only up to quadratic terms
in qi ’s in the instanton expansion. These quantities ni and nij are collected for all
the 36 pCICY geometries in Table 8. Subsequently, the flat vacua are stabilized by
giving the dilaton a VEV by solving the following supersymmetric flatness condition:
DS W eff (S) = ∂S W eff (S) + W eff (S)(∂S K eff ) = 0 .

(2.7)

In addition, we demand that for the vacua to be physical in the sense of lying within
the weak string-coupling and large complex-structure regime, i.e., hgs i < 1, hui i > 1
and hu2 i > 1.
2.2

Demonstrating the steps in an explicit example

In this section, we present an explicit example to illustrate the various steps. Subsequently,
the same strategy will be replicated with all the remaining 35 CYs. For this purpose, we
take the pCICY called as M2,33 in Table 7 where the relevant topological data for this
pCICY can also be found. The task of scanning PFFV demands to find flux configurations
satisfying the following explicit conditions,

Here the last condition follows from solving the orthogonality relation M i Hi = 0 for the
F 1 flux, which has been subsequently eliminated from the other ingredients such as M i ,
p̃ij F j , p̃i F i and Nflux keeping them as a function of only three fluxes, namely F 2 , H1 and
H2 . As we observed in [1], the conditions listed in Step S1 for the pCICYs with h1,1 = 2
define two possible choice of fluxes, i.e.
{H1 > 0, H2 < 0, F 2 > 0}

or {H1 < 0, H2 > 0, F 2 < 0} .

(2.9)

This means that also for the pCICY database, we can continue to scan among all the
possible flux configurations defined in the following region in the flux space
H1 ∈ {−300, −1} ,

H2 ∈ {1, 300} ,

F 2 ∈ {−300, −1} ,

(2.10)

which has to satisfy Step S1. Given that the Käher cone conditions are already imposed
on the flux vector M i , the intermediate quantities are not expected to get singular within
this choice of range for the fluxes.
We find that there are a total of 41 flux configurations which satisfy the conditions
of being PFFV as mentioned in Step S1. Subsequently, following the Step S2 about the
flux scaling redundancy, this number reduces into 26 while further imposing the condition
M 1 6= M 2 in Step S3, one is left with 24 flux configurations as presented in Table 1.
Subsequently, after performing Step S4, we note that there are only 2 flux configurations
(numbered as 8 and 20 in the collection of 24 PFFV in the Table 1) which result in physical
VEVs for dilaton and complex structure moduli. The details on these physical various along
with the moduli/dilaton VEVs are given respectively as below,
F i = {33, −12} , Hi = {−4, 3} ,

and

In fact the PFFV numbered as 15 (out of the list of 24) in the Table 1 gives a quite small
value of the string coupling gs , however, one of the complex-structure saxion slightly goes
beyond the physical regime as seen below:
F i = {62, −24} , Hi = {−3, 2} ,

Statistics of perturbative flux vacua for pCICYs

Following the methodology described for the explicit example in the previous section, we
performed the flux vacua analysis for all the 36 pCICYs with h1,1 = 2, and the results
obtained by following the three steps S1-S3 are shown in Table 2. We also note that the
number of flat flux vacua listed in Table 2 are obtained by choosing the three independent
fluxes |F 2 |, |H1 |, |H2 | in the range {1, 300} while the remaining flux F 1 is obtained by
solving the orthogonality condition M i Hi = 0.

Note that the CY # 32 in Table 2 is the same which appears in the Kreuzer-Skarke database
as well, and therefore its statistics matches with the one presented in [1].
From Table 2 we also observe that although Step S1 results in a reasonably large
number of PFFV for most of the examples, applying the next steps S2 and S3 reduces
these numbers vary significantly. For example, the K3-fibered CY numbered as 10 of Table
2 results a total of 10432 number of PFFV from Step S1 which is reduced to 3019 after
Step S2, and is further reduced to 2769 after Step S3.
Some comments on PFFV with M 1 = M 2
In order to appreciate the reduction in the number of PFFV in Step S3, let us present some
insights on this step. Actually, the PFFV configurations with M 1 = M 2 are equivalent
to H1 + H2 = 0 and do not result in trustworthy physical vacua through Step S4. As
observed in [1], this happens because the dilaton minimization process uses two pieces
appearing at different orders of suppression within the same series expansion of the nonperturbative effects. To see it quickly, one can consider the following simplified form of the
supersymmetric flatness condition Eq. (2.7) which is obtained by using M 1 = M 2 = M ,
e2πM hsi (πM s + 1) (F 1 n1 + F 2 n2 ) = −(2πM s + 1) (F 1 (2n11 + n12 ) + F 2 (n12 + 2n22 )) ,
(3.1)
where s = Im(S). This shows that the first order non-perturbative terms will have to
complete with the second order terms, and neglecting the pieces containing nij ’s lead to
no physical solution. Therefore, for all the PFFV configurations resulting in M 1 = M 2 one
can check the sign of the following quantity,
A=

F 1 (2n11 + n12 ) + F 2 (n12 + 2n22 )
.
F 1 n1 + F 2 n2

(3.2)

If one finds that A ≥ 0, this would imply that there is no physical solution in the weak
coupling regime for the corresponding flat vacua. Also, even if A < 0, one has to check that
one gets weak coupling i.e., hsi > 1. By these criteria, one can discard several flat vacua
arising from Step S1 and Step S2 which is analyzed in Table 3 as a result of Step S3.
Table 3: Number of PFFV configurations with M 1 = M 2 = a H1 /F 2 along with the
sign(A) where A is defined in Eq. (3.2). There are 5 cases for which the parameter A turns
out to be of the form 00 which we will explore separately.

In Table 3, we present some estimates about the sign(A) for all such vacua in each of the
pCICY 3-fold, which shows that it is always fixed in each of the CY 3-fold. Moreover, A
takes an undetermined form for five pCICY examples and let us note that in the presence
of a symmetry in the CY 3-fold, such PFFV with M 1 = M 2 get interesting in the sense
that they remain flat against the non-perturbative effects as well, and we will discuss such
a class of vacua in the upcoming section.
3.1

K3-fibered mirror pCICYs

For pCICY 3-fold with h1,1 = 2, there are 16 geometries which are K3-fibered. These
are in Table 2 where we present the corresponding number of PFFV configurations for
Nflux ≤ 500. Let us mention that there are a total of 48810 PFFV configurations arising
through the K3-fibered pCICYs which is a significant percentage of the total number of
PFFV being 64520 obtained after Step S1. The statistical distribution of these 48810 PFFV
is shown in Figure 1 with a distinction based on a range of D3 tadpole charge given as
0 < Nflux ≤ 50 n where n = {1, 2, .., 10}.
Finding the physical vacua
In fact, in order to give some more insights at the intermediate steps, let us mention that
although there is a total of 48810 number of flat vacua arising from the 16 K3-fibered
pCICYs after Step S1, using our prescription described in three steps S1-S3, this number
is reduced to 17209 after Step S2, and finally to 16215 after the Step S3. We investigate
all these PFFV configurations for fixing the dilaton by using the non-perturbative effects

– 11 –

in Step S4, and find that there remain only 559 PFFV which give physical solutions in the
sense of being in the weak coupling and large complex structure limit. To be more specific,
we impose: hgs i < 1, hu1 i > 1 and hu2 i > 1, however, this appears to be quite restrictive for
many of the PFFV to be ruled out. Although we provide the details of all the 559 physical
vacua in a separate attachment for the interested readers, for illustration purpose here we
present one such physical vacua with the lowest value of |W0 | ≃ 2.0769 · 10−27 as below,

Finally let us mention that all the 16 K3-fibered pCICYs can indeed give physical vacua
via fixing the axio-dilaton flat valley through the non-perturbative effects in Finst .
3.2

Non K3-fibered mirror pCICYs

For pCICY 3-folds with h1,1 = 2, there are 20 geometries which are not of the K3-fibered
type as mentioned in Table 2, where we have also presented the number of PFFV configurations for Nflux ≤ 500. We find that there is a reasonably good number of the PFFV in
this class to begin with, i.e., after Step S1, which results in 15710 PFFV configurations,

– 12 –

with their statistical distributions being shown in Figure 2. However, these numbers reduce significantly to 2886 after Step S2, and to 1447 after Step S3. This illustrates the
fact that our three-step strategy S1-S3 turns out to be crucially useful in eliminating the
over-counting of (equivalent) vacua, before looking for the axio-dilaton stabilization using
non-perturbative effects.

Finding the physical vacua
After considering the axio-dilaton minimization along with demanding the weak coupling
and large complex-structure VEV requirements for all the 1447 PFFV configurations remained after Step S3, one is left with only 3 physical vacua arising from 2 out of 20 non
K3-fibred pCICYs. These are numbered as 3 and 12 in the collection of 36 pCICYs in Table

– 13 –

2. We find that the CY # 3 has a unique physical solution described by the following data,

Hi = {−8, 7} ,

Further, the CY # 12 has the following two physical vacua which have some correlations,
F i = {86, −48} ,
Hi = {−4, 3} ,
M i = {1/94, 2/141} ,
p̃ij F j = {−72, −87} , p̃i F i = 21 ,

and

In addition, one thing worth noticing in these physical vacua of the non K3-fibered pCICYs
is the significantly larger value of Nflux , which may be hard to achieve in typical minimal
global constructions. This could be used as an argument for filtering out the non K3-fibred
CYs for the model building interests with the low |W0 | values.

Exponentially flat flux vacua (EFFV)

We now discuss a special class of PFFV configurations which is protected against the nonperturbative (Finst ) corrections due to an underlying symmetry of the CY 3-fold, and we call
them as exponentially flat flux vacua (EFFV). Given the correlation we have observed between the EFFV and the presence of the so-called “non-trivially identical divisors” (NIDs)2
in our KS database analysis for CYs with h1,1 = 2 [1], it is a very natural to explore such
possibilities in pCICY database. The very first reason is the fact that NIDs are very natural
to get for most of the pCICYs as observed in [33], and therefore it is interesting to ask
if this connection between the NIDs and EFFV has a deeper reason via investigating the
underlying symmetry in the CICY geometry, and whether it can be extended to pCICYs
with large h1,1 as well.
4.1

EFFV for pCICYs with h1,1 = 2

These vacua fall under the category of the PFFV which we have studied in some good
detail so far, which in addition satisfies: M 1 = M 2 or equivalently H1 + H2 = 0 for h1,1 = 2
case. One can directly read-off from the supersymmetric flatness condition in Eq. (3.1) that
for exponential flat flux vacua, we simply need to demand the following conditions for the
2

The presence of NIDs facilitates an exchange symmetry in the model which is useful for constructing
orientifolds with non-trivial odd-sector [33–35, 42–44] leading to interesting odd-axion phenomenology [27,
32, 45–50].

first order protection,
H1 = −H2 ,

n1 F 1 + n2 F 2 = 0 ,

(4.1)

while one needs one additional condition in order to extend the protection against second
order non-perturbative effects given as below,
H1 = −H2 ,

n1 F 1 + n2 F 2 = 0 ,

F 1 (2n11 + n12 ) + F 2 (n12 + 2n22 ) = 0 .

(4.2)

By considering the values of prepotential coefficients ni and nij from Table 8, we find that all
the ni and nij coefficients are positive in addition to ni ’s being always integral valued while
nij can take rational values as well. Recall that using the orthogonality condition M i Hi = 0,
we have already fixed F 1 in terms of the remaining three fluxes, namely {F 2 , H1 , H2 } and
one can check the consistency of those F 1 ≡ F 1 (F 2 , H1 , H2 ) expressions for each of the 36
pCICYs with Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2). However, given that we have already collected the PFFV
data, e.g., the one obtained from Step S1 in Table 2, we can directly test Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2)
on those PFFV configurations. In this investigation we find that although there are several
CY examples with n1 F 1 = −n2 F 2 , however, after demanding M 1 = M 2 as well, there
remain only five CYs which have such PFFV configurations. Moreover, we find that those
vacua also satisfy Eq. (4.2) ensuring the exponential protection of second order as well.
The details are collected in Table 4, which shows that there are a total of 9543 PFFV
configurations which turns out to be exponentially flat. Also, because of the underlying
symmetry, this protection can be anticipated to hold to all orders in the non-perturbative
series of Finst .

It may be worth to note that none of these 5 CYs are K3-fibred, and therefore these are
not relevant for realizing low |W0 | in the physically trustworthy regime, as we discussed in
the previous section.
Some more insights of the exponentially flat flux vacua
Let us note that, there are only two fluxes (out of four) which remain independent for
EFFV configurations because one flux F 1 for our convention is already determined by the
orthogonality relation M i Hi = 0 and one can eliminate, say, H1 by H1 = −H2 leaving only
H2 and F 2 fluxes to remain independent. Moreover, given the fact that the flux rescaling
redundancies in Step S2 demand H1 and H2 to be coprime, the condition M 1 = M 2 implies
that such a reduced set of EFFV configurations have H1 = −1 = −H2 or H1 = 1 = −H2

– 15 –

where we follow the former choice throughout this work. Therefore, there is only one flux
parameter (F 2 ) which determines the distinct EFFV configurations.
The conditions discussed above altogether turn out to be quite strong as they significantly simplify the Nflux expression relevant for the D3 tadpole cancellation,

(4.3)

where in the last step we have used H 1 = −1 and H 2 = 1. Now as we have mentioned before,
we have solved the orthogonality relation M i Hi = 0 for F 1 which can be subsequently
expressed in terms of three fluxes H1 , H2 and F 2 . So, this solution can be also used as a
relation between F 1 and F 2 fluxes which holds for PFFV configurations in a given CY, for
the fixed choice of Hi ’s we have. It turns out that F 1 = −m F 2 where m take the following
rational values for all the 36 CICYs respectively,

Eq. (4.4) shows that there are five CYs for which F 1 = −F 2 (i.e., m = 1) holds, and
these are precisely the ones which have the symmetry in their respective CY geometries as
listed in Table 4, and are numbered as {2, 8, 9, 25, 32} in the full list of 36 pCICYs. From
Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) and Table 8, one can read-off that F 1 = −F 2 is necessary for having
the exponentially flat flux vacua, and for these EFFV one finds that Nflux can be simplified
to be always given as Nflux = −F 2 > 0 which follows from Eq. (4.3). Also, we find that
M i flux components, say M 1 = M 2 = M , for these five examples are respectively given as

Thus, we find that for each value of Nflux = −F 2 , there are as many as EFFV as F 2 subject
to satisfying the integrality condition in Eq. (4.6), which means that CY # 2 and 25 will
have as many EFFV as one chooses the value of F 2 , while for CY # 8, 9 and 32 the number
of EFFV is half of the choice of F 2 flux value.

EFFV for pCICYs with h1,1 ≥ 3

For investigating the exponential flatness beyond the two-field case of h1,1 = 2, we need
to look at the general form of the dilaton dependent “effective” superpotential W eff (S)
which is obtained by simplifying the generic flux superpotential along the perturbatively
flat valley U i = SM i , and can be given as below [1, 15],

di

Using Eq. (4.7), one can anticipate that for having the exponential flatness along the dilaton
direction one needs to impose the following condition,
M i = M ∈ Q∗

∀i,

(4.8)

where Q∗ denotes the set of non-zero rational numbers. In fact, if there exists a pair of
components such that M i 6= M j for some i 6= j, then one can perform the axio-dilaton
stabilization similar to the h1,1 = 2 case, irrespective of the fact whether it may (or may
not) result in physical vacua and hence will accordingly lead to the corresponding PFFV
being useful (or not) for phenomenological purposes. However, in any of the two such
possibilities, the exponential flatness will be lifted.
Let us also note that the simple looking condition in Eq. (4.8) is quite restrictive in
the sense that it demands identifications beyond merely finding the so-called NIDs at the
level of topologies of the 4-cycles inside the CY 3-fold. Given that only 111 spaces out of
7820 favorable ones are a priory not suitable to have NIDs [33], this demand in Eq. (4.8)
suggests that although the pCICY dataset is quite rich in having the NIDs, it would not
be easy/frequent to find examples which can give EFFV. This will be better manifested
after we present the complete analysis later on.
Now, while working with an appropriate basis and by considering the non-perturbative
effects to the first order only, Eq. (4.7) can be further expressed as below,
W

eff

(S) ≃

(4.9)

where the sum over i runs in the h1,1 of the mirror CYs we are using. Using this leading
order piece along with the Kähler potential in Eq. (2.4), the F -flatness condition in Eq. (2.7)
simplifies into the following form,
e−2π s M (1 + π s M )

X

F i ni = 0 .

(4.10)

i

Therefore for the PFFV configurations which satisfy the requirement that all the components of the M i flux vector are identical, the flatness is protected at the first exponential

– 17 –

order if the following condition holds,
Mi = M

∀i ,

X

F i ni = 0 .

(4.11)

i

Recall that M > 0 follows from the Kähler cone conditions which imply that (1 + π s M )
cannot be set to zero for solving for the dilaton s. For the particular case of h1,1 = 2, we
find that n1 = n2 and F 1 + F 2 = 0 hold for the five pCICYs due to the underlying CY
symmetry w.r.t. an exchange of the type 1 ↔ 2 within various quantities such as divisor
topologies (in terms of NIDs), intersection polynomial, the second Chern numbers and the
GV invariants.
Now we check the exponential flatness against the second order effects so that to reduce
the vacua with accidental flatness at the first order, which may (or may not) occur. For
that purpose, we include the next order terms in the effective superpotential which takes
the following form,

Now, the protection for the flatness will be extended to the second order if the following
relations hold,
Mi = M

∀i ,

F i ni = 0 ,

F i (2nii + nij ) = 0 .

(4.13)

Therefore if the ni , nii and nij for i 6= j are identical due to underlying symmetries of the
P
CY 3-fold, then it is sufficient to demand i F i = 0 to guarantee EFFV configuration.
We have investigated all the CY 3-folds which have the exchange symmetry in terms of
NIDs, and have further checked for those which have a unique topology so that to expect ni
being equal (along with M i ’s) for all i. We find that there are only 31 such examples (out of
7820 favorable pCICYs), which means 26 more apart from the 5 examples of h1,1 = 2 cases
which we have analyzed in detail. We tabulate the values of ni and nij for all these 31 CYs
in Table 9. We find that out of the 26 examples with h1,1 ≥ 3, which have a single divisor
topologies for each of them, there are 8 CYs which have h1,1 = 3, 9 CYs have h1,1 = 4, 6
CYs have h1,1 = 5 while the remaining 3 CYs have h1,1 = 6. Looking for EFFV, we find
that although there are 8 pCICYs for h1,1 = 3 which have the possible exchange symmetry
in terms of being NIDs but ni being equal holds only for three examples for which we have
checked that F 1 + F 2 + F 3 = 0 also holds. Given that a genuine exchange symmetry should
respect the invariance of the SR ideal, intersection polynomial, c2 (Ji ) as well as within the
GV invariants, we anticipate that merely having NIDs may not be enough for guaranteeing
the exponential flat flux vacua. With this logic we conclude that there are only 13 pCICYs
which can have EFFV of which 5 are those corresponding to h1,1 = 2 while 8 corresponds
to h1,1 ≥ 3.

– 18 –

It has been argued in [51, 52] that there can be a superpotential contribution of the
following kind arising either from gaugino condensation on spacetime-filling D3-branes or
the Euclidean D(−1)-branes (also referred to as E(−1)-instantons),
Wnp (S) ∝ ei f S ,

(4.14)

where f is some flux dependent quantity, though it appears to be absent in generic models
from the recent study of [53]. However, note the fact that for the exponential flat flux
vacua all the complex structure moduli are already aligned along the axio-dilaton direction
which remains the only flat direction in the solution, and therefore the use of the fluxes in
achieving the PFFV still have significant effects. The dilaton can receive VEVs from various
contributions arising from several other sources such as string-loop corrections [54, 55] or
α0 -corrections [56] which can subsequently facilitate the complete minimization of the flat
valley.
Finally, let us mention that having less pCICYs resulting in EFFV configurations
means finding the physical vacua through PFFV configurations is more likely and hence
this observation about rarity of EFFV configurations should be considered in support of
the overall goal of arguing the generality of PFFV vacua and KKLT scheme of moduli
stabilization using pCICYs.

Conclusions

A dynamical realization of the low values for the GVW flux superpotential |W0 | has been
at the center of the type IIB orientifold models such as KKLT, and in this work, we have
extended our previous study on flat vacua using the CY 3-folds from the KS database [1]
to the mirror of the so-called pCICY 3-folds.
We first performed a systematic analysis of the PFFV using 36 pCICYs with h1,1 = 2
for which the number of PFFV configurations obtained at various stages (and before fixing
the dilaton valley) are given in Table 2. Subsequently, we classified the models into two
categories, one which has mirror CY of a K3-fibered type and the other one which is not
of the K3-fibered type. We observe that all the 16 K3-fibered CYs result in physical vacua
while only 2 out of 20 CYs of non K3-fibered type give physical vacua. Thus, there are
only 18 out of 36 pCICYs which give physical vacua via fixing the flat valley through nonperturbative effects Finst . In the end, we find a total of 562 number of physical vacua arising
from these 18 pCICYs, and the flux configurations corresponding to the lowest value of
|W0 | turns out to give |W0 | ∼ 10−27 . The statistics of 562 physical vacua distributed to
their respective pCICYs is presented in Figure 3.
One of the main observations we make is the fact that the number of PFFV is dominated by the K3-fibered pCICYs, and in each of the four step, namely S1-S4, of our approach
towards reaching the physical vacua, the percentage of contributions arising from the K3fibered CY geometries increases. This is summarized in Table 5. These results support the
observations made from the KS database analysis in [1].

Table 5: Percentage of contributions arising from the K3-fibered CY geometries.
Moreover, given the fact that most of the pCICYs are K3-fibered and this number
increases with increasing h1,1 of the pCICY [26], one may anticipate to have a significant
landscape of the perturbative flat flux vacua from the pCICY dataset which has a total
of 7820 favorable CY 3-folds. Although we do not have a clear analytic understanding
about why the K3-fibered CYs result in more PFFV, and so far this is purely an empirical
observation for us, however given that K3-fibration somehow reduces the number of nonzero triple intersection numbers by a theorem of Oguiso [57] (see [58] also) which translates
into the fact that the K3 divisor can appear only linearly in the intersection polynomial,
and hence many of the triple intersection numbers would vanish; for example see Table 7
where the intersection numbers corresponding to the divisor topology T1≡K3 are listed. It

– 20 –

can be seen that there are always two intersection numbers out of four which vanish. This
can possibly result in a less restrictive set of conditions to be satisfied for realizing the flat
vacua, e.g. via Step S1. Therefore one can naively think that one of the reason for larger
PFFVs for K3-fibered CYs should be rooted in this fact. However, a systematic analysis of
pCICYs beyond the low h1,1 is indeed desirable to be explored for seeing more possibilities
or pattern given that for larger h1,1 , one may be able to make a further classification as
whether the K3-fibered pCICYs are multiply-fibered and if there is a distinction in the
PFFVs’ pattern which one could observe. These are indeed interesting future directions
one would like to pursue further.
We have also explored the possibilities of the so-called exponentially flat flux vacua
(EFFV), and have found that there are five CICY 3-folds with h1,1 = 2 which can have
such vacua. We found that there is a total number of 9543 EFFV configurations for these
five CY 3-folds, out of a total number of 64520 PFFV configurations arising from all the 36
pCICYs. We subsequently extended the search of finding such vacua for CICY geometries
with larger h1,1 which can have an underlying symmetry. To begin with, building on the
learning from the h1,1 = 2 cases, we anticipated that the presence of NIDs can be useful to
find CYs which are suitable for having EFFV. However, the detailed analysis showed that
there are additional restrictions arising from the identification of the components of the
M i flux vector, which restricts the choice to only those CYs which have a single topology
for all their coordinate divisors. In this context using the divisor topologies of pCICYs as
presented in [33] we find that apart from the five examples of h1,1 = 2, there are only
26 more pCICYs with 3 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 6 with this property, and thus resulting in a total of
31 pCICYs (in the list of 7820 favorable geometries) which could be a priory suitable for
giving EFFV. However, we further observed that despite having a single divisor topology
in a given CY (i.e., having an exchange symmetry among all the divisors at the level of
NIDs), the symmetry was not respected at the level of GV invariants dependent quantities
ni and nij defining the prepotential in Eq. (2.6), as listed in Table 9. The underlying reason
for this mismatch at the GV invariant level can be correlated with the fact that intersection
polynomials do not respect the symmetry. After taking this factor into account, we are left
with only 8 pCICYs with h1,1 ≥ 3, which can give exponentially flat flux vacua. However,
let us emphasize that having less EFFVs means finding the physical vacua through PFFVs
is more likely and hence supports the overall goal of arguing the generality of such vacua
and KKLT scheme of moduli stabilization using pCICYs.
Finally, let us also mention that despite the extensive use in constructing MSSM-like
models, the CY 3-folds of the pCICY dataset have been very rarely utilized for moduli
stabilization and any subsequent phenomenological purposes such as realizing de-Sitter
vacua and inflationary aspects, and our aim in this paper along with a companion paper
[33] has been to take some initiatives in these directions.

pCICY geometries

In this appendix, we briefly introduce the pCICYs and review their topologies.
A pCICY is defined as the zero-locus of a set of k homogeneous polynomials pj (z) in
an ambient space A given by products of Pni , satisfying

A pCICY X is said to be favorable if h1,1 (X) = h1,1 (A). All pCICYs apart from 70 are
favorable [26].
Using the configuration matrix in Eq. (A.2), it is possible to compute also the intersection polynomial of any favorable pCICY, lifting the integral of the triple intersection
number κ0ijk over the ambient space, i.e.
κ0ijk =

Table 6: Divisor topologies for favorable pCICYs and their frequencies of appearance, as
we discussed in [33].
In the main text of this paper, we focused on constructing PFFV for compactification
on the mirror pCICYs with h2,1 = 2. For this reason, we collect all the topological data for
favorable pCICYs with h1,1 = 2 in Table 7.
Table 7: Topological data for favorable pCICYs with h1,1 = 2 taken from [33]. The first
number of pCICY in the second column is the corresponding number in the list of only
favorable pCICY, while the second number is the number of the pCICY following [26]. The
classical triple intersection numbers κ0ijk are collected as {κ0111 , κ0112 , κ0122 , κ0222 }, while other
details for topologies Ti’s are given in Table 6.

In constructing the complex structure prepotential for the mirror pCICYs we needed the

computation of the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the pCICYs with h1,1 = 2. They have
been computed using INSTANTON [61], with an algorithm reviewed in Appendix B of [1] (see
also [27]). In Table 8 we list the coefficients entering the prepotential Finst in Eq. (2.6).

Table 9: Details of Finst (defined in Eq. (2.6)) for all the 31 CYs which are relevant to
examine the EFFV are presented, along with the presence of an underlying symmetry. The
counting of ni also determines the h1,1 for the corresponding CY. It is worth noticing that
the first example has all the ni ’s being equal, while the symmetry does not hold for higher
order GV dependent quantities, nii and nij .
