Abstract:
We present a comprehensive study of Kähler moduli stabilisation in Type IIB flux compactifications, combining advanced numerical techniques with analytical methods. Our JAX-based
computational framework enables efficient scanning of the UV parameter space, while incorporating α′ corrections, loop and non-perturbative effects, as well as uplift contributions to the scalar
potential. The implementation features rigorous vacuum validation protocols derived from analytic
results. We apply our methods to explicit flux compactifications on more than 80,000 Calabi-Yau
threefolds with h1,1 ≤ 6 Kähler moduli. By systematically scanning over a wide range of values of
the flux superpotential W0 and the string coupling gs , we find explicit realisations of every established Kähler moduli stabilisation scenario: for 10−15 ≤ |W0 | ≤ 10−2 we obtain both KKLT-like
and Kähler uplifted vacua, while for the broader range 10−1 ≤ |W0 | ≤ 102 we recover LVS as well as
LVS-like hybrid solutions. Notably, we discover significant parameter regions where multiple vacua
coexist within a single flux potential, including novel configurations pairing AdS, Minkowski, and
dS minima with different volume hierarchies. These findings enable, for the first time, the analysis
of vacuum decay processes within fixed flux configurations, complementing the established theory
of transitions between distinct flux vacua and decays towards decompactification.

Introduction

Despite more than two decades of research on flux compactifications in Type IIB string theory,
the space of concrete models with all moduli stabilised remains remarkably small compared to the
vast number of potential configurations. Over the years, progress has enabled explicit stabilisation
of complex structure moduli and the dilaton from quantised fluxes, while parallel progress has
been made in systematic approaches to Kähler moduli stabilisation, including perturbative and
non-perturbative effects [1–5] (for general reviews see e.g. [6–8], for the state of the art see [9]).
Given that moduli stabilisation represents the primary challenge for connecting string theory
to observable physics, it is crucial to both expand the catalogue of explicit flux compactification
solutions and extract more general principles. Of particular importance is the task of locating de
Sitter solutions in physically viable parameter ranges, which would provide compelling evidence for
their existence.
Building on prior analytic and numerical studies such as [10–15], we develop a comprehensive
framework to address problems within the realm of numerical Kähler moduli stabilisation. To handle
the exponential increase in numerical cost as the number of moduli grows, we leverage the JAX
ecosystem [16], using just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and automatic differentiation to compute the
full Type IIB scalar potential efficiently. With this implementation we can flexibly specify general

–1–

expressions for both the superpotential W and the Kähler potential K as well as include additional
potential contributions from uplifting.
Let us note that our analysis currently assumes prior stabilisation of complex structure moduli
and the dilaton by fluxes, focusing specifically on the Kähler sector. In the long run, our methods
can be integrated with existing software tools like JAXVacua [15] to stabilise all moduli simultaneously, enabling systematic studies of backreaction and cross-coupling effects within a single, unified
computational environment.
In this work, we specifically implement a benchmark scenario that incorporates the full set of
effects needed for controlled Kähler moduli stabilisation: the non-perturbative terms in W from
Euclidean D3-brane instantons and D7-brane gaugino condensation, the leading (α′ )3 correction to
K computed in [17], logarithmic volume redefinitions [18, 19], and a positive uplift term modelling
the energy of an anti-D3-brane as in [2]. Alternative uplift mechanisms, such as from T-branes [20],
or additional perturbative corrections, like the one-loop string corrections derived in [21], can be
incorporated straightforwardly.
Our pipeline begins by selecting a Calabi-Yau geometry from established databases like [22],
and computes the total supergravity scalar potential for given UV parameters, such as the flux
superpotential W0 , and the string coupling constant gs . With our routines, we systematically
explore vacuum structures across all Calabi-Yau manifolds with h1,1 ≤ 6 Kähler moduli obtained
from [23]. By scanning over values of W0 and gs , a variety of vacua are found for geometries with
h1,1 ≤ 6. For small values |W0 | ≲ 10−2 , we reproduce supersymmetric AdS KKLT minima [2] and
non-supersymmetric Kähler uplifted solutions [10, 24], both of which can be uplifted to de Sitter
by standard contributions such as anti-D3-branes. For generic values |W0 | ≳ 10−1 , we recover the
familiar LVS-type non-supersymmetric AdS solutions [3, 4]. We further identify hybrid solutions
resembling those in [13], blending traits of different established vacua constructions.
By varying |W0 | continuously, we demonstrate how LVS minima smoothly transition into either
KKLT or Kähler uplifted solutions. Strikingly, over a range of intermediate values of |W0 |, two
distinct local minima coexist in the same scalar potential.1 Upon adding an explicit uplift term to
the potential, we find all combinations of AdS, Minkowski, and dS vacua for both branches. This
simultaneous realisation of multiple vacua in a single potential, rather than across distinct flux
choices as studied e.g. in [26], provides a novel setting for studying vacuum transitions in string
compactifications. Depending on parameters, the small-volume minimum can have either higher or
lower vacuum energy, enabling cosmological applications such as inflation.
We organise the paper as follows. After a brief introduction in §2, we describe our numerical
implementation in §3. Subsequently, we present our main findings in §4, starting with reproducing
known KKLT, LVS and Kähler uplifted solutions (§4.2) before describing novel configurations like
coexisting minima in §4.4. In §5, we study the behaviour of our numerical solutions under variations
of |W0 | (cf. §5.1) as well as implications for stability and tunnelling rates in the landscape (cf. §5.2).

The four-dimensional EFT

In this section, we briefly describe the four-dimensional EFT implemented in our numerical framework. Further, we summarise three of the established Kähler moduli stabilisation scenarios which
will show up later in our numerical results.
2.1

N = 1 Calabi-Yau flux compactifications

We consider Type IIB superstring theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold X. Concretely,
we focus on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces X embedded in toric varieties obtained from triangulations
1 Recently, coexisting F -flat flux vacua for complex structure moduli for the same choice of 3-form fluxes have
been discovered in [25] via the numerical techniques of [15].

the database of O3/O7 orientifolds with h1,1 ≤ 6 compiled in [23].

Ti = τi + i θi .

(2.5)

Let us note that, in general, the real part of Ti is affected by higher order corrections. That is,
in the presence of quantum corrections to the Kähler metric Kiȷ̄ , the relationship between Kähler
parameters ti and holomorphic coordinates Ti changes as described in e.g. [29–35], see [9] for a
recent discussion.
The hyperplanes of KX give rise to inequalities of the form
HAi ti ≥ 0 ,

A ≥ h1,1 (X) .

(2.6)

For the Calabi-Yau threefolds studied in this work, these constraints become more constraining at
large h1,1 (X) because KX becomes more narrow [36]. On top of that, we typically have to impose
even stricter bounds on e.g. divisor volumes τi in order to work in the geometric regime where the
α′ expansion is under control. This will play a crucial role in our numerical analysis of §4.
The moduli fields ϕI = (z α , τ, Ti ) in our effective theory interact through an F -term scalar
potential VF which is completely specified by a Kähler potential K and superpotential W . It can
be written as

VF = eK K I J DI W DJ¯W − 3|W |2 ,
(2.7)
¯

where K I J is the inverse Kähler metric and DI W the Kähler covariant derivative defined as
DI W = ∂I W + KI W .

–3–

(2.8)

In what follows, we assume that all complex structure moduli z α and the axio-dilaton τ can be
stabilised at high scales by solving Dτ W = Dzα W = 0 in the presence of a 3-form flux background
[1], see e.g. [15, 25, 37, 38] for progress in numerically finding flux vacua.2 After integrating out z α
and τ , we work with an effective scalar potential V for the remaining Kähler moduli given by

V = eK K iȷ̄ Di W Dȷ̄ W − 3|W |2 .
(2.9)
To compute the scalar potential (2.9), we have to specify a Kähler potential K and a superpotential W . We define the Kähler potential as
K = Kcs − log(−i(τ − τ̄ )) − 2 log (V) ,

(2.10)

in terms of the corrected Calabi-Yau volume in Einstein frame
V = V (0) + δV .

(2.11)

Here, V (0) is the classical Calabi-Yau volume defined in Eq. (2.3) and δV = δV(ti , s) incorporates
general perturbative corrections to the Kähler potential. We reiterate that, for our purposes, Kcs
in (2.10) is a constant determined by the stabilisation of the complex structure moduli z α .
The superpotential used in our analysis is given by
X
W = W0 +
AD e−aD TD ,
(2.12)
D

where W0 is the VEV of the flux superpotential [40] again determined by the stabilisation of
complex structure moduli. The second term accounts for non-perturbative contributions from Dbrane instantons hosted on some effective divisor D = ci Di , ci ∈ Z, such as Euclidean D3-branes
and gaugino condensation on seven-branes [41]. We write aD = 2π/cD in terms of the dual Coxeter
number cD of the corresponding gauge theory living on the worldvolume of the brane configuration
wrapping D. In general, the sum in Eq. (2.12) ranges over smooth,3 rigid divisors D for which the
Pfaffian prefactors are non-vanishing [41]. In addition, the sum also includes “rigidified” divisors,
i.e., non-rigid divisors for which certain deformation modes have been lifted through suitable gauge
fluxes FD [43–46], see also [12, 47].
2.2

Explicit setup and Kähler moduli stabilisation

Let us now describe the explicit ansatz that we make for the perturbative corrections δV to K as
defined in (2.11). For this ansatz, we compute the F -term conditions and the scalar potential for
the Kähler moduli analytically which we occasionally use to compare our numerical implementation
with. Moreover, we review the established Kähler moduli stabilisation procedures, namely KKLT
[2], LVS [3] and Kähler uplifting [10, 24], for our explicit ansatz for K and W .
We will work with the Kähler potential including the leading perturbative corrections corresponding to the tree-level (α′ )3 correction of BBHL [17, 48] and a logarithmic volume redefinition
following the arguments in [18, 19].4 Explicitly, we can write for the corrections δV
δV = δVBBHL + δVlog

(2.13)

2 Alternatively, non-supersymmetric flux vacua with D W ̸= 0, D α W ̸= 0, but ∂ V = ∂ α V = 0 can also be

found via the methods of [39].
3 Under certain conditions, there can also be contributions from singular divisors to the non-perturbative superpotential as studied in [42].
4 It is important to note that, unlike the BBHL correction, these logarithmic corrections are not yet fully established
in concrete string constructions. As discussed in [49, 50], corrections to the scalar potential scaling as V −8/3 may
compete with or even dominate over the BBHL term. For a proposal that employs a resummation of these corrections
to achieve perturbative moduli stabilisation, see [51].

and the logarithmic correction

(2.15)

Similar to [52], we assume that α is small and positive. It is important to emphasise that the microscopic origin of corrections of the form (2.15) remains an open question; for a detailed discussion,
see [19].
For the moment, we remain agnostic about the underlying mechanism generating contributions
to the superpotential (2.12). In what follows, we assume for simplicity that our basis of H4 (X, Z)
includes h1,1 rigid divisors contributing non-trivially to the superpotential (2.12), while neglecting
commensurate contributions from additional rigid divisors. Then, computing the inverse Kähler
metric explicitly for the ansatz (2.13), the scalar potential can be written as

where the various terms ϕ0 , ϕ1 , ϕ2
are collected in App. A. This master equation generalises
the expressions of [13, 53] by including additional perturbative corrections, see also [9] for similar
expressions for V and its derivatives. We stress that our numerical implementation does not use
(2.16), but rather derives (2.9) directly.
We note that, to accurately determine the axion VEVs, one would need to know the phases of
Ai which we typically set to zero by hand. Since finding the axion VEVs is mostly straight forward,
we will refrain from commenting on them in what follows.
Below, we revisit the three established Kähler moduli stabilisation procedures KKLT [2], LVS [3]
and Kähler uplifting [10, 24] in the presence of the perturbative corrections as defined in Eq. (2.13).
KKLT scenario
The KKLT construction [2] provides an explicit procedure for obtaining supersymmetric AdS vacua
through non-perturbative effects in the superpotential, with perturbative corrections to the Kähler
potential playing a secondary role. The solutions can be expressed succinctly by starting from the
F -term conditions for all Kähler moduli
Di W = ∂Ti W + (∂Ti K) W = 0 .

(2.17)

Early works, such as [54–56], have already provided evidence for the existence of supersymmetric
AdS4 vacua satisfying (2.17), though making use of special structures and without hierarchical
scale-separation. More recently, fully explicit supersymmetric AdS4 minima have been found in
explicit Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications containing O(100) moduli fields featuring large
scale-separation [14] and warped throats [9].These works have provided the tools to numerically
construct supersymmetric AdS4 minima for any h1,1 , see also §3.1.
Let us compute (2.17) for our ansatz for the Kähler potential (2.10) and the superpotential

which is equivalent to a similar expression in §5.1 of [14].
As long as |ϵi | ≪ 1 is guaranteed, the size of the 4-cycle volumes τi is mainly controlled by
ln(W0−1 ). Achieving Einstein frame volumes τi ≳ 1 requires |W0 | ≪ 1, which requires sufficient
tuning through suitable choices of fluxes. In practice, solutions of this type can be systematically
constructed through perturbatively flat vacua [57] or, alternatively, by fine tuned cancellations in
the flux superpotential [25].
Large Volume Scenario
The Large Volume Scenario (LVS) provides an alternative moduli stabilisation framework in Type
IIB compactifications, where Kähler moduli are stabilised through a combination of non-perturbative
effects in the superpotential and perturbative corrections to the Kähler potential.
To simplify the discussion, let us start with the case of two Kähler moduli by setting h1,1 = 2
where we denote the two 4-cycle volumes by τb and τs with volume form
1
3/2
V (0) = √ (τb − τs3/2 ) .
9 2

(2.22)

Then, the analysis begins with the master equation (2.16), taking the large volume limit where τb
is sent to infinity. Keeping only the leading order terms in this limit, we find the scalar potential
√ √
V e−K = h̃|W0 |2 + 2as τs As |W0 |e−as τs cos(as θs + θ0 ) + 12 2 τs a2s A2s V (0) e−2as τs ,
(2.23)
where θ0 is the phase of W0 , and h̃ is given by

3 
h̃ =
δV + V (0) (3 V (0) δV ′′ − δV ′ )
(0)
2V

(2.24)

in terms of δV ′′ = ∂V2 (0) δV. As this potential depends on a single axion θs , minimisation along this
direction yields as θs = π − θ0 . The stabilisation of the Kähler moduli depends critically on the sign
of h̃. Provided that h̃ > 0, the first and third term in (2.23) are positive and compete with the
second term in such a way that a minimum materialises at
V (0) ∼ |W0 | eas τs ,

τs ∼ 1/gs ,

⟨V ⟩ ∼ −

|W0 |2
.
V3

(2.25)

Given that LVS depends on this delicate balance between non-perturbative and perturbative
corrections in (2.23), the explicit form of the Kähler potential K in (2.10) is imperative. In particular, for the perturbative corrections in Eq. (2.13), we find
h̃ =

3ξˆ
3α
+ (0) 2/3 .
4V (0)
(V )

–6–

(2.26)

Hence, the first term in (2.23) receives two competing contributions: the BBHL correction 4V3ξ̂(0)
3α
(positive for h2,1 > h1,1 ) and the logarithmic correction (V (0)
(positive for α > 0). Clearly, the
)2/3
latter generically dominates unless α is appreciably small.
For compactifications with h1,1 > 2, the above process leaves h1,1 − 2 moduli τj (j ̸= s, b) as flat
directions at this order. These can be stabilised through two distinct mechanisms: either by higherorder string corrections to the Kähler potential, leading to a hierarchy τb > τj ≫ τs , or through
additional non-perturbative effects, producing τb ≫ τj > τs [58]. The specific stabilisation pattern
depends on the relative strength of these corrections in a given compactification. Throughout, we
only focus on additional non-perturbative contributions to W to stabilise the remaining Kähler
moduli.
Kähler uplifting
The third type of solutions appearing frequently in our numerical analysis below were proposed in
[24] and subsequently refined in [10, 59]. This class of minima of V uses the interplay of α′ effects
in the Kähler potential and non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential W . Indeed, they
emerge for values of |W0 | exceeding a critical threshold |W0max |, beyond which KKLT solutions
cease to exist. Specifically, starting from a solution to Di W = 0 for sufficiently small |W0 | and
increasing the value of |W0 | iteratively, supersymmetry breaking can occur at some V (0) > δV when
|W0 | = |W0max |. Then, depending on the range of |W0 | ≳ |W0max | in which a minimum persists,
these non-supersymmetric Kähler uplifted solutions are either anti-de Sitter or de Sitter.
Since V (0) at the minimum decreases with increasing |W0 |, these minima are typically plagued
by issues related to control over perturbative corrections. Although we will not address these
concerns in this work, we point out that our framework described in §3 can be employed to study
such control problems quite systemically and efficiently.
In practice, de Sitter solutions of this form have been previously found in [47, 60]. In our
investigations, we find a special variant of these solutions due to the specific form of δV as defined
in Eq. (2.13).
Classification of different scenarios
Beyond the three established scenarios KKLT, LVS and Kähler uplift mentioned above, it is conceivable that moduli can be stabilised through unknown mechanisms. For example, there can be
hybrid vacua [13] that exhibit characteristics of both standard LVS vacua and conventional KKLT
models.
More generally, it is therefore useful to classify models by the process in which each Kähler
modulus is stabilised. For instance, one can imagine the following scenarios:
• All moduli are stabilised by non-perturbative effects (like in KKLT).
• Some moduli are stabilised by non-perturbative effects but others by perturbative effects as
in LVS, including fibre moduli stabilisation [61].
• All moduli are stabilised by perturbative effects as in recent proposals such as [51, 52, 62, 63].
All of these scenarios can be easily studied within our numerical framework, which will be introduced
in the next section.

3.1

Numerical Kähler moduli stabilisation

The primary challenge in applying numerical methods to string moduli stabilisation stems from the
high dimensionality and complex functional form of the scalar potential given in equation (2.16).
For a system with h1,1 complex Kähler moduli Ti , we must search a (2h1,1 )-dimensional field
space parametrised by (ti , θi ). The task is basically a (2h1,1 )-dimensional constrained optimisation
problem involving huge systems of coupled, highly non-linear equations.
A first step towards systematically exploring moduli potentials with the help of numerical tools
was taken in [13] by working with an explicit implementation of (2.16) (with α = 0). Hybrid optimisation algorithms and other computational techniques were employed to systematically explore
scalar potentials in Calabi-Yau compactifications of Type IIB with h1,1 ≤ 3 for minima.
In principle, one could envision developing algorithms capable of handling hundreds of Kähler
moduli, similar to those described previously [9, 14].5 While such implementations currently favour
KKLT-like solutions, the minimisation algorithm of [14] is capable of exploring the extended Kähler
cone and, after suitable modifications, allows to include anti-D3-uplifts and backreaction from
complex structure moduli [9]. Moreover, by implementing detailed analytic expressions summarised
in App. D of [9], all tree level α′ corrections including worldsheet instanton contributions can be
incorporated in the analysis.
3.2

The implementation

In this work, we make progress by providing a versatile and efficient implementation to expedite
the numerical search for string vacua. The F -term scalar potential is completely specified by the
notion of the Kähler potential K, the holomorphic Kähler coordinates Ti and the superpotential
W . By providing only K, W and Ti as inputs, our code derives the full effective theory with the
help of automatic differentiation.
To achieve this, we are using the JAX ecosystem [16] which provides various features. By using
auto-differentiation, it allows for efficient, and precise gradient computations in models with complex
mathematical structures, such as those found in string compactifications. Compared to traditional
means to compute derivatives like via finite differences or symbolic differentiation, this approach
proves particularly powerful in enabling scalable explorations of high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Building on this foundation, we have developed an algorithmic framework that generates all necessary functions to evaluate both the scalar potential and F -term conditions. These general-purpose
5 See also [64] for progress in finding axion minima.

–8–

functions remain model-agnostic until supplied with compactification data from the Calabi-Yau
orientifold, including χ and h1,1 , and specific parameters from higher-scale physics (such as gs , Kcs ,
and W0 ).
A clear advantage is that our implementation is less prone to errors. Previous implementations
can only be used for a very specific ansatz for K, W and Ti making them susceptible to errors
whenever significant modifications are required. Instead, our framework is completely modular
allowing us to work with arbitrary inputs for K, W and Ti . In this sense, our approach allows
to explore the string landscape more broadly by modelling different forms of the perturbative
corrections to K (and Ti ) as well as by being able to find arbitrary minima for Kähler moduli as
explained in the subsequent section. In this work, we will work with the specific expressions (2.13)
and (2.12) for K and W .
Beyond these enhancements to physics capabilities, our implementation features increased computational speed. While for standard python implementations the computational cost of evaluating
the scalar potential and its derivatives typically scales unfavourably with h1,1 , our algorithms alleviate this problem through just-in-time compilation as previously argued in [15] for flux vacua.
3.3

Minimisation of scalar potentials and validation of solutions

To locate minima of the scalar potential, we employ three distinct numerical approaches. The first
procedure directly solves the F -term conditions via Eq. (2.21). The remaining two procedures are
solution-agnostic, working with the full scalar potential, thereby enabling broader exploration of
vacua; they differ primarily in how the parameter space is sampled.
We introduce ti0 as the initial guess for the two-cycle volumes. To sample ti0 inside the Kähler
cone KX of the Calabi-Yau threefold X, we impose the Kähler cone conditions in Eq. (2.6)
on the ti0 as a set of numerical inequalities. These are solved using linear programming via
scipy.optimize.linprog to generate valid starting points ti0 ∈ KX .
We employ the following three strategies to obtain a minimum of the scalar potential, whose
associated Kähler parameters are denoted by ti⋆ :
1. We solve the F -term conditions Di W = 0 numerically. As discussed in §4.2 and similar to
[9, 14], the logarithmic form of these conditions in Eq. (2.21) offers significant computational
advantages.
2. We operate directly on the scalar potential trying to find solutions to the extremum equations
∂i V = 0. This allows us to locate non-supersymmetric minima of the Kähler moduli potential,
including LVS-type solutions.6
3. By again working with the full scalar potential, we employ the iterative method described
in §2.2 by first locating KKLT solutions and then using these as initial conditions to search
for non-SUSY vacua at incrementally larger values of |W0 |. This approach proves effective in
identifying Kähler uplifted solutions that would otherwise be inaccessible via direct minimisation.7
For each strategy, we solve the resulting system of equations via scipy.optimize.root. For each
candidate solution, we check that the minimum lies inside Kähler cone ti⋆ ∈ KX and that the Hessian
eigenvalues are positive.8
6 Of course, a subset of solutions obtained in this way may still preserve supersymmetry due to D W = 0 as we
i
will see later in §4.2.
7 Similar strategies were employed in [9] to find de Sitter minima from anti-D3-brane uplifts.
8 In principle, we could allow for some negative eigenvalues in AdS minima provided that the tachyonic mass is
above the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound [65].

4 of 5 steps in Fig. 1, from generating a start point in the Kähler cone to running all three optimisation
methods and passing any solutions found through our checks.

Beyond these minimisation methods, we strategically choose initial points ti0 ∈ KX to optimise
convergence. E.g., in two-modulus LVS scenarios, prior knowledge guides the selection of starting
points: the large modulus typically stabilises near τb ∼ V 2/3 and the small modulus satisfies as τs ∼
ln(V), cf. Eq. (2.25). By finding the corresponding Kähler parameters ti0 ∈ KX where these
conditions are approximately satisfied, we increase the likelihood of finding LVS solutions, even in
examples with h1,1 > 2.

Numerical landscape analysis and coexisting minima

In this section, we present the numerical results obtained using the computational framework described in the previous section. First, we describe our selection of datasets in §4.1. Subsequently,
we demonstrate in §4.2 that applying in our numerical techniques successfully recovered all known
minimum types described in §2.2 across all sampled geometries with 2 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 6. We also perform
more in-depth searches in §4.2 on individual manifolds to highlight the prevalence and parametric
distributions of certain string vacua within our datasets.
A particularly interesting outcome of our numerical searches is the generic appearance of double
minima candidates in manifolds supporting multiple solution types. As detailed in §4.4, we consistently find pairs of minima — including AdS-AdS, Minkowski-AdS, and dS-AdS configurations —
existing simultaneously within the same potential (i.e., for identical values of parameters such as
χ, gs , W0 , etc.). We comment on the broader implications of vacuum stability and inter-minima
tunnelling in §5. In §4.5, we extend our analysis beyond the F -term scalar potential by including
explicit uplift terms, particularly from anti-D3 branes. These uplift mechanisms allow us to convert
AdS vacua into metastable de Sitter vacua.
4.1

Search parameters and dataset selection

Initially, we performed large scale searches across the toric Calabi-Yau database of [23] for h1,1 ≤ 6.
Specifically, we run superficial scans using the three approaches described in §3.3 using three values
of gs ∈ {0.03, 0.1, 0.3} and six values of −W0 ∈ [10−15 , 100.5 ], for a total of 18 parameter points per
geometry. Furthermore, we assume all h1,1 Kähler moduli to contribute to the non-perturbative
superpotential.10 Geometries were then ranked by their success rate in this quick scan, guiding our
selection for more detailed, fine-grained searches described in §4.2. The computational efficiency of
9 The average time was taken for the first 1,000 geometries for h1,1 ≥ 4 rather than the whole database for
efficiency.
10 Although this has been explicitly confirmed for large values of h1,1 , for smaller values it must be verified on
a case-by-case basis. In this sense, our analysis applies only to cases where the h1,1 4-cycles are rigid or can be
rigidified.

Figure 2: Success rate (left) and largest volume solution (right) for the large scan over the geometries listed
in Table 1. Here, the different colours correspond to the individual minimisation strategies as explained
in §3.3: blue for supersymmetric, yellow for general non-supersymmetric and green for solutions found via
the iterative procedure. We observe that the success rate of all strategies decreases with h1,1 , whereas the
largest volume obtained in any of the solutions stays roughly constant.

our approach is demonstrated by successful identifications of both SUSY and non-SUSY minima,
with typical runtimes of just a few seconds on standard laptop hardware. We summarise the number
of geometries per h1,1 , the average success rate for finding vacua as well as the average time per
run in Table 1.11
Fig. 2 shows the success rate for the three different minimisation strategies separately as well as
the largest volume solution obtained for each h1,1 . The drop in success rate for uncovering minima
per starting point is a natural consequence of our coarse initial scan and can be substantially
improved with more targeted, in-depth searches. Indeed, this preliminary survey was designed
to pinpoint the most promising geometries for the more detailed investigations that follow below.
Specifically, we next demonstrate that our framework, detailed in §3, can be efficiently used to
recover all established solution types described in §2.2, namely KKLT, LVS, and Kähler uplifted
solutions, as well as hybrid solutions as found previously in [13].
4.2

Numerical KKLT, LVS and Kähler uplift solutions

We now present solutions that are anticipated based on the analytic considerations of §2.2, before
summarising novel solution types subsequently.
KKLT solutions
The KKLT minimisation method proves particularly efficient, consistently outperforming direct
minimisation of the full scalar potential by solving the simpler F -term conditions directly. A key
advantage is the usage of the logarithmic expression (2.21) for the Kähler moduli Ti .
Fig. 3 illustrates a representative KKLT minimum identified for compactifications on the degree
18 hypersurface in P4[1,1,1,6,9] by our F -term solver and subsequently verified through direct scalar
potential minimisation. The potential is generated for parameters

11 We use the counting of FRST classes of [66]. We note that, while these Calabi-Yau threefolds have distinct Wall

data, they can still be topologically equivalent as complex manifolds. Topological inequivalence classes of Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces constructed from triangulations of reflexive polytopes in four dimensions for h1,1 ≤ 5 were enumerated
in [66], see also [67] for related attempts.

The triangulation is determined by the height vector (−1, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0). As can be verified explicitly, this geometry has more than h11 rigid divisors (see e.g. [23]). Our search employed the
F -term conditions directly, exploring 50 values of gs in [10−2.5 , 100.5 ] and 100 values of |W0 | in
[10−10 , 101 ] totalling 5,000 individual runs.
Fig. 4 displays the parameter space regions where KKLT solutions exist, with coloured points
indicating solutions and colours representing the stabilised volume. As anticipated for KKLT solutions, the volume depends strongly on |W0 | ∼ Ae−aτ but remains largely insensitive to the value
of gs . This behaviour follows from Eq. (2.21), where gs influences Kähler moduli stabilisation only
through subleading perturbative corrections to the Kähler potential. Consequently, the inclusion
of gs -dependent perturbative corrections produces negligible changes in the stabilised volumes.
Comparing scans with and without perturbative corrections shows that the presence of gs dependent corrections shrink the viable |W0 | window for KKLT minima. In particular, the BBHL
−3/2
correction scales as gs
, pushing viable vacua to ever smaller |W0 | as gs decreases. As discussed in
§2.2, the full scalar potential (cf. Eq. (2.16)) develops singularities when V ∼ δV(ti , s). For KKLT
solutions, the volume scaling ai Re(Ti ) ∼ ln(|W0 |−1 ) (recall Eq. (2.21)) motivates the dotted line in
each plot showing ln(|W0 |−1 ) = χ2/3 a1 /gs , which approximates where V ≈ δVBBHL and correctly
predicts the observed scaling behaviour.

specified in Eq. (4.5).

LVS solutions
Next, let us employ our search algorithm to identify LVS minima by working directly with the full
scalar potential in Eq. (2.16). That is, instead of solving DTi W = 0 as in the previous section, we
are searching for solutions to ∂ti V = ∂θi V = 0 from random starting points ti0 within the Kähler
cone KX . A priori, this may not automatically give rise to an LVS-type solution, but simply to a
generic (non-)SUSY (A)dS4 minimum. Locating such non-SUSY AdS4 minima therefore presents
significantly greater challenges than their supersymmetric counterparts.
We present one representative minimum at h1,1 = 2 in Fig. 5. This minimum shows the expected
characteristics of LVS solutions. As before, we consider compactifications on P4[1,1,1,6,9] [18] with both
BBHL and logarithmic perturbative corrections. The minimum was obtained for the parameters
gs = 0.1 , W0 = −0.628 , A1 = A2 = 1 , a1 = a2 = 2π/20 , α = 10−1 .

volume modulus satisfy

s ln(V) ;

τb = τ1 ≈ 927 ≈ 1.21 V 2/3 .

(4.8)

Our numerical algorithms successfully generate comprehensive LVS solution datasets, revealing
characteristic parameter scalings. Fig. 6 presents results from scanning 50,000 parameter combinations across gs ∈ [0.03, 0.3] and |W0 | ∈ [10−5 , 102 ]. By minimising the full potential, we see that
our method finds a large majority of supersymmetric solutions. This is not surprising as the LVS
solutions lie in asymptotic regions of the moduli space and are therefore much harder to find.12 After filtering out supersymmetric solutions, we obtain the plot on the right hand side in Fig. 6. This
plot shows that, as we vary |W0 | and gs , the lower volume LVS solutions coalesces with KKLT-like
solutions, which are growing in volume. This is a hint that, for a single choice of parameters like
W0 and gs , the same potential can host both LVS- and KKLT-like minima. This will be explored
further in §5.1.
Much as in Fig. 4, the first two panels of Fig. 6 map where vacua appear in the (|W0 |, gs )plane. Unlike the KKLT case where V depends almost exclusively on |W0 |, LVS minima show
a two-parameter sensitivity: volumes decrease as |W0 | is lowered but grow for smaller gs . This

|W0 | e1/gs , and explains why LVS vacua
behaviour matches the characteristic LVS scaling V ∼ gs
persist to much larger |W0 | than their KKLT counterparts, even overlapping in parameter space,
see §4.4 and the stability discussion in §5.2.
The third plot in Fig. 6 demonstrates our LVS check from §3.3. Here, we test how close our
solutions come to satisfying the standard LVS relations as τs ∼ ln(V) and τb ∼ V 2/3 . We thereby
identify valid LVS solutions within a defined region around the origin.
Kähler uplifted minima
Next, let us describe our results for the third class of solutions, namely Kähler uplifted minima
[10, 24] as reviewed in §2.2. To reiterate, these solutions emerge when |W0 | exceeds a certain
threshold where SUSY-breaking effects from α′ -corrections provide a source for uplifting.
Our search algorithm employs an iterative approach: beginning with a known KKLT minimum
at small |W0 |, we gradually increase |W0 | while using each solution as the initial guess for subsequent
optimisations for ∂ti V = ∂θi V = 0. This incremental parameter variation combined with informed
12 In principle, one can devise methods to find approximate LVS solutions:

starting from some point ti0 ∈ KX ,
i
locate points t1 ∈ KX in Kähler moduli space τk ∼ ln(V) for some k = 1, . . . , h1,1 and subsequently use ti1 ∈ KX
as the starting point for finding the true minimum of the potential. Similar ideas were employed in [9, 14] to find
KKLT minima.

Clearly, looking at the size of the volume and corrections in (4.10), this vacuum most likely lies
outside the regime of perturbative control.
Kähler uplifted solutions emerge at larger |W0 | values where F -term minimisation cannot be
achieved within the regime of perturbative control. To map this transition, we conduct parallel
scans for both KKLT and non-SUSY solutions across identical parameter ranges.

Figure 9: De Sitter solutions from Kähler uplifting in the small-volume non-SUSY regime. A subset of
solutions to Eq. (2.16) yield positive potential values, confirming the prediction of [60] for the Calabi-Yau
threefold P4[1,1,1,6,9] [18] at h1,1 = 2. The yellow curve shows their proposed relation |W0 | ∼ 70.2 gs2.35 where
dS minima are expected to occur. For this plot, we use the same parameters as [60]: Ai = {1.11, 1},
ai = {2π/24, 2π/22}, χ = −540, eKcs = 0.03, and α = 0.

Fig. 4 previously established the existence of a critical |W0 | threshold (marked by the red
dotted line at V (0) ∼ δV) beyond which KKLT solutions vanish. Using our iterative minimisation
approach on the complete potential, we successfully extend the solution space beyond this boundary.
The resulting Kähler uplifted minima, stabilised at smaller volumes through SUSY-breaking uplift
effects, are presented in Fig. 8.
These Kähler uplifted minima exhibit several distinctive features. First, these solutions occupy
parameter regions with larger |W0 | values than their KKLT counterparts, corresponding to smaller
volumes. However, unlike KKLT solutions where volume decreases monotonically with |W0 |, the
Kähler uplifted solutions show volume growth as |W0 | increases further. Second, the volume of the
solutions is small with V (0) ∼ 10 signalling a probable loss of perturbative control.
Perturbative corrections establish an upper |W0 | bound for KKLT solutions, beyond which
Kähler uplifted solutions emerge in narrow W0 bands for each gs . These bands represent the delicate
balance where corrections provide sufficient uplift without inducing runaway decompactification.
The required parameter tuning reflects the KKLT solution’s weak sensitivity to perturbative effects
- in some cases, like the CY manifold of Fig. 8, the potential transitions directly to runaway before
achieving positive values.
The most interesting feature of these solutions is their ability to stabilise all moduli in de
Sitter configurations through pure Kähler uplifting, without explicit uplift terms. Fig. 9 validates
the prediction of [60] that solutions along specific gs -W0 trajectories (yellow line) receive sufficient
Kähler uplift to produce small-volume de Sitter minima. More specifically, [60] provide a condition
on the value of the flux-induced superpotential and the topological data of the Calabi–Yau threefold
that, if satisfied, ensures the existence of a metastable de Sitter vacuum. Indeed, working with
the same choice of parameters as in [60] for the Calabi-Yau threefold P4[1,1,1,6,9] [18] at h1,1 = 2,
our numerical analysis verifies that de Sitter vacua indeed arise along the expected trajectory
|W0 | ∼ 70.2 gs2.35 , see Fig. 2 in [60].
4.3

Additional hybrid minima

Throughout §2 and §4, we have organised vacua into three well-known classes, namely KKLT, LVS,
and Kähler uplifted solutions, even though our numerical minimiser from §3 is agnostic about which
type of solution it finds. One might therefore expect hybrid minima outside these categories, as
reported in [13].13 Such solutions can arise whenever moduli are stabilised e.g. through a combination perturbative corrections to the Kähler potential and non-perturbative corrections to the
superpotential, but in the absence of a swiss-cheese like structure of the volume. More specifically, extending the LVS mechanism to h1,1 > 2 generally demands additional perturbative or
13 We stress that our categorisation is slightly different to the one used in [13].

potential specified by the parameters in Eq. (4.13).

non-perturbative ingredients. Whenever one modulus, say τb , satisfies τb ∼ V 2/3 and is stabilised
by perturbative corrections, with the remaining small cycles fixed non-perturbatively, one recovers
a genuine LVS vacuum. In geometries without a clear swiss-cheese structure, or with multiple cycles receiving leading-order perturbative stabilisation, one instead finds hybrid minima that behave
qualitatively like LVS vacua. Solutions of this type were coined LVS-like hybrid minima in [13].
Our numerical framework readily identifies both pure LVS and these LVS-like hybrid solutions
even at higher h1,1 . For example, we looked at the Calabi-Yau threefold with h1,1 = 6 obtained
from a triangulation of the polytope with vertices given by

Coexisting Vacua in the Landscape

Our numerical searches revealed the intriguing phenomenon of multiple minima coexisting within
the same scalar potential for specific (gs , W0 ) parameter values.14 We identified several distinct
14 This feature, exhibiting multiple solutions for a single set of parameters has also been observed in [11].

coexistence scenarios; LVS minima paired with KKLT solutions, and LVS minima coexisting with
Kähler uplifted solutions. Notably absent were potentials containing both KKLT and Kähler uplifted minima simultaneously; a finding consistent with the theoretical framework developed in
§2.2 and the numerical results presented in §4.2. These multiple-minima configurations appear
generically across various manifolds, requiring only the existence of LVS-type solutions.
Our identification protocol builds upon the minimisation and filtering procedures from §4.2. We
systematically compare solutions across three categorised lists (KKLT, LVS, and Kähler uplifted) for
the same values of (gs , W0 ). Solutions consistently appear in either KKLT-LVS or Kähler upliftedLVS pairs, with the LVS solution always occupying the larger volume region. The coexistence of
an LVS solution with a partner minimum depends primarily on the value of |W0 |. Indeed, for
KKLT-LVS pairs, the KKLT solution exists when |W0 | is sufficiently small to produce volumes
V (0) > δV(ti , gs ). When present, these KKLT solutions naturally coexist with LVS minima in the
same potential. In contrast, for Kähler uplifted-LVS pairs, Kähler uplifted solutions typically exceed
the KKLT threshold on |W0 | and hence they can pair with LVS minima at larger |W0 | values. The
detailed evolution of solution types with varying |W0 | is analysed in §5.1.
LVS solutions consistently appear at larger volumes, but the relative depths of minima vary.
In KKLT–LVS pairs (both AdS), the KKLT minimum is always deeper and at smaller volume.
In contrast, Kähler uplifted–LVS pairs show more varied behaviour due to the uplift mechanism,
ranging from deep AdS to Minkowski, or dS minima, depending on the uplift strength.15
This progression yields several possible double-minima configurations within the same potential
such as: two AdS minima with the smaller-volume solution deeper (KKLT-LVS or Kähler UpliftedLVS pairs), two AdS minima with the larger-volume solution deeper (Kähler Uplifted-LVS pairs),
Minkowski (Kähler Uplifted) + AdS (LVS) pair, and dS (Kähler Uplifted) + AdS (LVS) pair. An
example of both a KKLT-LVs (AdS - AdS) pair and a Kähler Uplifted - LVS (dS - AdS) pair are
shown in Fig. 11.

fixed as specified in the caption of Fig. 12. This produced approximately 4.5 × 105 , 2.5 × 105 , and
6.6 × 105 solutions. After removing SUSY KKLT solutions, we found 14,819 instances of multiple
minima arising within the same potential.

Adding explicit uplifting sources

Thus far, we have focused exclusively on the F -term potential. In typical compactifications, additional uplifting terms, e.g. from anti-D3 branes, T-branes or D-terms, arise that can raise AdS
minima to de Sitter. These uplift contributions scale as ∼ V −n , n < 3, with the overall volume V.
Indeed, the introduction of an explicit uplifting term in our analysis enables new possibilities.
Specifically, we will consider anti-D3 brane uplifts16 which lead to an additional contribution
Vup =

(4.17)

in the full scalar potential. We keep the coefficient Dup here as a free parameter, and simply note
that it can in principle be computed in explicit examples where warped Klebanov-Strassler throats
[1, 73] can be realised, see in particular [9] and [74] for recent discussions in the context of KKLT
and LVS respectively.
Adding an explicit uplift term unlocks vacuum pairings beyond those found in §4.4. In particular, we can now engineer a small-volume AdS minimum coexisting with a larger-volume Minkowski
or de Sitter vacuum — configurations unattainable by Kähler uplifting alone. As described in §4.2
and §4.2, LVS and KKLT minima often coexist for the same (gs , W0 ). After applying the uplift
of Eq. (4.17), the LVS branch becomes a metastable dS solution while the KKLT branch remains
a deep, slightly SUSY-broken AdS vacuum. In §5.2 we analyse the resulting tunnelling dynamics.
More generally, by varying the uplift strength one can realise any combination of AdS, Minkowski,
and dS minima at both small and large volumes in a single potential.
We explore the landscape of double dS solutions by first considering the pairs of double minima
we found in Fig.12 (where we in effect had Dup = 0). This provides a start point for us to run two
16 An explicit bound on the net D3-tadpole required to maintain control over warping corrections in LVS in the

presence of anti-D3 branes has been derived in [68]. Similarly, control issues in KKLT due to warping effects have
been identified e.g. in the context of the singular bulk problem [69–71], see also [72] for a strengthened version of
the problem.

as we slowly increase Dup , in a procedure reminiscent of how we found the Kähler Uplifted solutions
by increasing |W0 | when starting from a KKLT solution. The algorithm continues to increase the
uplift parameter until one of our solutions disappears (in effect the potential is now runaway at
that point). The solutions shown in Fig. 14 correspond to the double minima found in Fig. 12 that
survived uplifting both solutions to dS. All pairs of solutions that could be uplifted to double dS
minima contained a combination of Kähler uplifted and LVS-type solutions; all KKLT minima were
too deep and the uplift required to bring them to dS caused the LVS solution to be uplifted to a
runaway. Shown in Fig. 13 is an example of a KKLT-LVS solution pair, we can seen in the second
plot that when Dup ∼ 10−7 we have sufficient uplift to promote the LVS solution to dS, but the
KKLT solution is only effected at the 4th significant figure.

Dynamics in the string landscape

This section presents applications of our numerical framework that showcase its utility in studying
the string theory landscape. Our approach enables both efficient large-scale parameter scans and
detailed investigations of vacuum dynamics and stability. The framework is highly parallelisable,
allowing for extensive scans over values of the flux-induced superpotential W0 . This facilitates systematic studies of vacuum properties across wide regions of parameter space, and helps identifying
regions that support de Sitter solutions or exhibit interesting phenomenological features. Building on these results, our methods provide a foundation for studying dynamical processes in the
landscape — such as vacuum transitions and tunnelling.
5.1

Vacuum structure from |W0 | variation

We now proceed to examine the transitions between different vacuum types by systematically
scanning the flux parameter W0 . In KKLT solutions, the overall volume scales exponentially with
the divisor volumes |W0 | ∼ e−an τn , recall Eq. (2.21), whereas in the LVS regime one finds the
opposite scaling behaviour |W0 | ∼ V (recall Eq. (2.25)). Our numerical framework allows us to
probe these competing scalings within a single scalar potential by tracking, for example, how the
LVS minimum deepens and then gives way to a KKLT minimum as |W0 | is decreased. This allows
us to understand the continuous deformation between the two solution branches and the parameter
windows in which they coexist.
Let us first test the prediction that an LVS AdS vacuum shrinks as |W0 | decreases, whereas
below some critical |W0 | value a KKLT-like solution exists. We start from a potential with coexisting
LVS and supersymmetric KKLT minima obtained for flux compactifications on P4[1,1,1,6,9] [18] using
the same parameters as in Fig. 11, with τ1 ≡ τb and τ2 ≡ τs . We then tracked the volume of
each solution separately as |W0 | was lowered. As shown in Fig. 15, the volume indeed decreases
when starting from the LVS solution (top right), while the KKLT volume increases (top left).
Interestingly, the LVS solution branch eventually disappears below some threshold value |W0 | ∼
10−7 at which point the KKLT branch takes over.
We can similarly investigate the reverse transition, with increasing |W0 |, the vacuum shifts from
a KKLT AdS minimum to a non-supersymmetric Kähler-uplifted solution. As anticipated in §2.2,
once |W0 | exceeds a critical value, the family of KKLT solutions ceases to exist and is replaced
by a SUSY-breaking minimum. Fig. 16 illustrates this behaviour: starting from a small-volume
dS vacuum at large |W0 |, lowering |W0 | suppresses the uplift, first driving the solution to AdS,

Figure 16: Evolution of a small-volume de Sitter vacuum, coexisting with an LVS minimum, as |W0 |
is decreased. The solutions are computed using the iterative procedure of §3.2 for compactifications on
P4[1,1,1,6,9] [18] with the same parameters as in Fig. 15. Note that the LVS minimum remains present across
the entire scanned range of |W0 |.

then causing the Kähler-uplift branch to disappear below which the familiar KKLT AdS vacuum
reemerges, satisfying Di W = 0 and exhibiting the expected scaling.
Interestingly, the transition occurs while LVS solutions persist in the potential, enabling observation of various coexisting minima configurations through |W0 | variation alone:17
• dS (small-volume) + AdS (LVS) pairs
• Minkowski (small-volume) + AdS (LVS) pairs
• AdS (small-volume deeper) + AdS (LVS) pairs
• AdS (KKLT deeper) + AdS (LVS) pairs
Once uplifting terms are added, all combinations of dS/Minkowski/AdS exist.
5.2

Tunnelling and Stability

A second application of our results concerns vacuum decays. The stability of vacua in the string
landscape, including those identified in our analysis, has been the subject of sustained investigation [2, 59, 75–80]. Previous studies have examined both KKLT and LVS minima in a range of
configurations, considering their uplifted de Sitter versions (analysing tunnelling to larger-volume
solutions or decompactification) as well as their non-uplifted anti-de Sitter counterparts.
To date, the discussion has primarily focused on two decay channels:
1. decay of a candidate de Sitter vacuum towards the runaway decompactification regime, studied
via the Coleman–De Luccia formalism [81], and
2. transitions between distinct flux configurations, analysed using the Brown-Teitelboim formalism [82] of bubble nucleation, which determines viable decay channels and corresponding
vacuum lifetimes.
The decay probability per unit volume and time follows the standard exponential form
Γ ∼ e−B ,

B = Sinstanton − Sbackground ,

17 Recall that what we call small-volume is still larger than the string scale.

– 22 –

(5.1)

where S denotes the Euclidean action. In general, decay towards decompactification, although
exponentially suppressed, tends to dominate over decay to other flux vacua.18
Here, we propose a third decay channel that has not been previously considered. In Sections §4.4
and §4.5, we demonstrated the existence of configurations with multiple minima arising from fixed
flux choices, in which an LVS-type minimum coexists with either a KKLT or Kähler uplifted one.
The availability of explicit examples of scalar potentials in which all saddle points are known and
which, in principle, span different energy scales, offers a rich theoretical laboratory for investigating
the population of the landscape and cosmological implications. A comprehensive analysis of decay
rates between these vacua and their broader physical consequences lies beyond the scope of this
work. Here, we restrict ourselves to outlining some of their key potential implications:
• Vacuum decay towards another local minimum. Concrete calculations can be performed in order to determine the transition rate from a high energy de Sitter minimum to
the second local minimum for which the cosmological constant can be naturally tuned by the
fluxes to have zero or very small value. The decay rate to decompactification can be estimated
in a similar way. Notice that we have found all possible combinations in which the higher
minimum corresponds to smaller or larger volume. Naively the decay rate from a de Sitter
vacuum to a Minkowski vacuum is given by

where S(φ0 ) = 24π 2 /V0 and σ is the bubble’s tension with φ1 the location of the second local
minimum. In order to compare this decay rate to the one towards the runaway minimum,
we would need to compare the values of the wall tension in both cases, the value of V (φ0 ),
the value of the potential at the local maximum V (φmax ) or saddle that separates the two
local minima in order to estimate the height of the barrier, the validity of the thin-wall ap√
proximations, etc. In particular, we would need to compare the values of ∆φ Vmax for both
transitions in order to compare the wall’s tension in both cases. Hawking-Moss transitions
may also be implemented. All of this varies from case to case depending on the particular
compactification and flux choice and requires a systematic analysis. Furthermore, the coexistence of Minkowski and AdS minima allows us to explicitly provide a flux compactification
realising the second example discussed in [81], decay from Minkowski towards an AdS crunch
for which Γ is as above by changing the plus by a minus sign in the denominator.
• Runaway dilatonic domain walls. A quantitative analysis can be done for the existence
or not of the corresponding bounce solution connecting the two local minima in the presence
of the runaway, extending the discussion on runaway dilatonic domain walls in [78, 79].
• Not bubble of nothing decay. The fact that the value of the potential at the LVS minimum
decreases with decreasing W0 would naively lead one to believe that the minimum will continue
decreasing until it disappears to an unbounded from below potential. This is what happens
in 6d and it has been given an interpretation to a decay towards a bubble of nothing [83].
However, here we confirm the argument of [75] in which, at a critical value of W0 , the LVS
minimum disappears but a KKLT minimum appears and as W0 decreases further the value of
the potential at the minimum increases rather than decreases, avoiding the bubble of nothing
decay.
18 In [78, 79], it was argued that an instanton connecting two finite-volume vacua may not exist, potentially
obstructing the population of the landscape. See also the subsequent analysis in [80].

– 23 –

• Potential instability of AdS minima. For the case of double AdS minima, where either
Kähler uplifted-LVS or SUSY KKLT-LVS pairs coexist within the same potential, Coleman-de
Luccia transitions from LVS vacua to deeper minima at smaller volumes may occur, establishing the LVS solution as metastable. Notice that in this case there is no transition towards
decompactification (following the standard Coleman-de-Luccia prescription, see however [84]).
Since there is a dominant decay mode to another AdS this may have impact in attempts to
construct CFT duals of these AdS LVS minima [85, 86].
• Volume modulus inflation. The tuning of the fluxes that gives rise to two local (nonrunaway) minima can be used to smoothly deform the higher minimum such that this minimum disappears and gives rise to a potential which is naturally flat at high energies providing
an excellent candidate to realise volume modulus inflation [87]. As usual in the landscape,
the tuning is given by the richness of flux vacua. This may also lead to a period of kination
and its many potential cosmological implications as recently studied in [88–92].
• AdS wormholes and inflation. The fact that we can also get coexisting dS and AdS vacua
provides a concrete example of the scenario proposed in [93, 94] in which an Euclidean AdS
wormhole can give rise to a natural period of inflation with the dS vacuum responsible for
the current acceleration. This is an interesting alternative proposal for initial conditions as
compared to the Vilenkin, Hartle-Hawking proposals for the wave function of the universe.
Note also that in our examples we have both cases with the dS corresponding either to the
smaller or the larger volume case.

Conclusions

We have developed a unified computational framework for assembling and evaluating the full scalar
potential in Type IIB flux compactifications, including both perturbative and non-perturbative
ingredients. This implementation leverages just-in-time compilation, and automatic differentiation
based on the JAX environment [16] to deliver an efficient, scalable toolkit for systematic landscape
explorations. As a proof of principle, we have used this implementation to carry out non-exhaustive
searches for vacua across a range of Calabi-Yau orientifolds with h1,1 ≤ 6.
Our large-scale numerical study of Type IIB flux compactifications has uncovered new features
of vacuum structures which may have implications on the stability of such solutions in the string
landscape. By employing the optimised framework described in §3, we systematically surveyed
moduli stabilisation scenarios on Calabi-Yau threefolds with 2 ≤ h1,1 ≤ 6. In particular, we
confirm that as |W0 | is dialled down from large values, the LVS AdS minimum deepens until it
ceases to exist, at which point a KKLT-like minimum emerges and its energy increases as |W0 |
continues to decrease.
We further establish that distinct stabilisation mechanisms, specifically KKLT, LVS and Kähler
uplifted, often coexist for the same choice of flux parameters (cf. §4.4), even in the presence of explicit
uplifting contributions (cf. §4.5). Across all examined Calabi-Yau geometries, pairs of minima with
any combination of AdS, Minkowski, or dS vacua can arise simultaneously. The generic occurrence
of multiple local vacua at a single point in parameter space opens new avenues for vacuum selection
dynamics, tunnelling phenomena, and novel inflationary scenarios.
Our results reveal a richer web of interconnected vacua in the string landscape. The numerical
toolkit introduced here offers a potent platform for systematically charting this complex terrain.
Looking ahead, there are several exciting avenues to extend this work. First, integrating our
JAX-based Kähler-moduli implementation with complementary packages such as JAXVacua [15]
would enable fully unified scans that stabilise the axio-dilaton, complex structure, and Kähler
moduli in one pass, opening the door to systematic investigations of backreaction effects. Second,

the modular design of our framework means that additional corrections — such as higher-order
loop and α′ effects, brane-induced threshold corrections, or alternative uplifts like T-branes — can
be included with minimal effort, allowing a quantitative assessment of control and convergence.
Third, the discovery of coexisting minima suggests fertile ground for studying vacuum dynamics:
by computing tunnelling actions between vacua in a fixed potential, one could explore new channels
for vacuum decay and cosmological transitions within a single flux choice. Finally, pushing to larger
h1,1 and incorporating additional search strategies, maybe even guided by Machine Learning, may
uncover novel corners of the landscape, bringing us closer to concrete, fully stabilised de Sitter
constructions.
